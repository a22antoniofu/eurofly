00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,860
Welcome to Eurofly. Training. Charter flight training. Hello everyone, warm greetings and let

2
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:24,080
me welcome you finally to the first ever official English demonstration of a real-time flight in

3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:31,600
Eurofly 3, which is exactly what you'll be witnessing right now. And in case you're

4
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:39,620
listening to this or watching this at the time it's been published, you'll be probably very

5
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,720
interested in this because Eurofly 3, the new version, the long-anticipated version, is actually

6
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:53,240
coming soon. And by that I mean really soon, like within a matter of days or weeks at worst. So stay

7
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:53,660
tuned.

8
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,740
To those of you who've been expecting it, I'm really glad to be here, to be able to be here

9
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:06,420
finally. And I actually mean it because I'm aware, just like everyone else on the development team

10
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:13,380
is aware, that you've been waiting for this really for ages and that there's been several

11
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:22,060
promises, even if maybe just tentative ones, but still promises over the years that it's going to

12
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,060
come, you know, to be released.

13
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:30,580
Really soon. And yeah, there's been a delay, but just now we're finally about to release it. And still, it's

14
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:40,180
never come until now. So we're glad to be able to tell you that it's finally here. Everyone on the team

15
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:46,680
actually believed those promises at the time we made them. But as you as I'm sure many of you can imagine,

16
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:53,620
real life things often like to get in the way and busy schedules and families and other duties at work and

17
00:01:53,620 --> 00:02:00,700
at other places and so on. But let's not delve into this very much because this is no longer the case. It's

18
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:08,200
actually here or almost here. It may have been released already by the time you're watching this. So let's not

19
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:14,880
talk about the past. Let's talk about the present and the future. To those of you who may be coming to

20
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:21,940
Eurofly 3 for the first time, when hearing this, you may have never experienced the previous versions of the

21
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,680
game before.

22
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:30,700
I hope this is going to be as useful as it is to those who know what Eurofly is all about because they've played it

23
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:37,840
before and they can't wait to actually get their hands on the new features and on the changes on the new version of

24
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:47,300
the game. So as you've probably heard, or guessed by now, even those of you who haven't played it before, Eurofly is

25
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:53,120
an actual flight simulator, an audio simulator for the blind and visually impaired.

26
00:02:53,620 --> 00:03:06,560
So you will be flying and controlling a real aircraft, real plane. There's over 150 of them in total, I believe, different planes, and

27
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:16,900
you'll be flying on the real world map, an actual real accurate representation of the Earth, including all the various airports in the

28
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,320
different countries that exist out there.

29
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,540
So it's partly a game, but it's also a game.

30
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,040
So it's partly a game, but it's also a game.

31
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,540
So it's partly a game, but it's also a game.

32
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,040
So it's partly a game, but it's also a game.

33
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,540
So it's partly a game, but it's also a game.

34
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,460
So it's partly a game, but it's also a game.

35
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:24,960
So it's partly a game, but it's also a game.

36
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,460
So it's partly a game, but it's also a game.

37
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,120
So it's partly a game, but it's also a game.

38
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,620
So it's partly a game, but it's also a game.

39
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,120
So it's partly a game, but it's also a game.

40
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,620
So it's partly a game, but it's also a game.

41
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,120
So it's partly a game, but it's also a game.

42
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,620
So it's partly a game, but it's also a game.

43
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,120
So it's partly a game, but it's also a game.

44
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,660
So it's partly a game, but it's also a game.

45
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,160
So it's partly a game, but it's also a game.

46
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,660
So it's partly a game, but it's also a game.

47
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,660
It's fundamentally an Amanda blends to play.

48
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:42,940
map uh i'll be demonstrating everything and showing and explaining everything as though

49
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:48,860
no one none of you have played eurofly before because there have been so many things that are

50
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:54,460
new and different and changed in version three that essentially nothing has remained the same

51
00:03:54,460 --> 00:04:01,100
except maybe for just a few basic keystrokes so even if you knew how to fly a plane in version

52
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:06,860
2 even backwards you know you will still have to re-learn everything from scratch as though

53
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:15,660
you were a completely newbie pilot so as you can hear we are already in the main menu and

54
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:21,100
we've been welcomed by new jingle those of you who may have known the previous versions have

55
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:26,060
most certainly noticed this and there are several different jingles in version 3 now

56
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,540
we're going to get a different one every time we start the game so

57
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,020
the welcome

58
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,580
is actually going to be slightly different every time and by the way before i get started

59
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:43,980
with anything let me just briefly emphasize and also apologize for my english because

60
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,620
as i'm sure you can hear it's not my native language it's my second language

61
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:55,820
so let me apologize in advance for any mistakes i may make when recording this and that i'm

62
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:00,140
almost bound to make actually because i can tell you it's pretty difficult to

63
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:07,100
but i'm not trying to use this as an excuse but just as just as an explanation it's pretty

64
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:13,340
difficult to actually be flying a plane at the same time you really have to concentrate on a

65
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:18,700
lot of different things all at once and to be talking over it at the same time

66
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,780
so let's hope i'm not going to make any mistakes uh cross my across your fingers

67
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,180
for me if you can and wish me luck because i really don't want to kill any of my passengers

68
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:36,460
myself included but you know i am i have my life insurance secured so hopefully everything's going

69
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:45,740
to be okay even if i do get killed at least my family uh will not uh remain poor all right we

70
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:52,300
are we're in the main menu so let's take at the main menu exit training charter flights business

71
00:05:52,300 --> 00:06:01,020
flights scheduled flights free flights world map exploration profiles speaker test settings

72
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:08,700
add-ons about the program exit training as you can hear it's actually me voicing the menu for

73
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:15,500
now in the official english translation um because i'm the only one on the team who feels comfortable

74
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:22,140
enough at english to to actually do it and it's a pretty weird thing by the way to be hearing my

75
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,300
own i'm the only one on the team who feels comfortable enough at english to to actually do it and it's a pretty weird thing by the way to be hearing my own

76
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:28,300
voice as i'm talking to you at the same time but let's we'll not be spending much time in the main

77
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:39,100
menu today because we are to fly finally so let me let's let's make a flight from uh the london

78
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:48,300
heathrow airport in england or great britain to manchester also in england it's about 240

79
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,340
something kilometers long so it's going to take a while and it's hopefully going to give me enough

80
00:06:53,340 --> 00:07:03,980
time to explain everything properly you know in enough detail as we go um by the way i'm sorry

81
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:10,460
to those of you who live in the us and are used to the imperial measurement units you know like

82
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:18,140
miles and feet and gallons etc because i really can't use them for for the life of mine

83
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:25,260
sorry about that i've honestly tried to make the game hopefully more approachable to you

84
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:30,940
but i can't make any sense of them honestly and they're really confusing me because

85
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:36,380
i'm not used to them at all but at the same time you can never please everyone at the same time

86
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:43,820
there are certainly going to be many listeners perhaps maybe even more of them than uh those

87
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,220
of you who are in the us and many listeners from europe who are used to

88
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:58,140
um to the um metric units so no matter what i do there's always going to be someone who is

89
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:03,260
not really happy i i guess but i believe it's not going to be too much of a problem

90
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:09,260
because you will be able to uh just set your game your personal copy of the game the way

91
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,580
you like it and use whichever measurement units you like when you start playing

92
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,940
charter business sketch free flights so i'll be doing a free flight

93
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:22,260
free flight dialogue my planes combo box one collapsed but i'm actually going to have to rent

94
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:30,500
the the plane that i'm going to use because we'll be flying with the boeing 787 dreamliner

95
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:37,180
which is a plane that i'm not actually qualified for yet in the game uh it's not part of my own

96
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:42,920
personal fleet yet so i'm going to have to filter edit company planes combo box one filter edit

97
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:50,900
rental offer combo box england badminton use the rental or service that i can use as a as a pilot

98
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:56,920
for the eurofly company now in version three uh when doing this uh when trying to rent a plane

99
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,440
the first thing i have to do is choose the starting airport actually so where we'll be

100
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,380
starting our flight where the plane will be placed before i actually take off with it

101
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,480
england doncaster so england london heathrow

102
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,580
uh england

103
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,000
heathrow plane rental dialogue you are about to rent an aircraft that's not part of your fleet

104
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,800
for a free flight your account will be charged zero do you wish to continue and no button alt

105
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,300
plus a yes i do wish to continue oh by the way i'm sorry uh the buttons any button yes and no

106
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:31,460
are uh displayed in check in my native language so that's why the screen reader reads them wrong

107
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:37,000
but it's not a bug in the game it's actually because my system language my local language

108
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,840
is set to check and i i forgot to to change it uh but i will not be editing

109
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:42,900
it

110
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:49,800
out just like i will not be editing anything out during the flight so if i uh make a mistake and

111
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:55,240
it causes me to stall or to crash because i was talking about something and i forgot to do

112
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:03,000
something vital in the meantime or forgot to do or couldn't do it in time well let's let's keep it

113
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,480
authentic i just will not be editing anything out uh and that's why um i will not be charged

114
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,840
anything i will be charged zero for this rental because i will not be charging anything i will be

115
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:18,440
using what i have so similar to the use case one because i'm using a tester

116
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,920
only you know private beta version of the game plane selection dialogue select concord boeing

117
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:30,200
787 dreamliner so let's select the 787 dreamliner and if i press enter now europe wielding controls

118
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:39,560
ready europe uk greater london hillingden harman's operate link we are airport london heathrow at the

119
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,920
uh heathrow airport sitting in the cockpit of our plane and we're ready to to get going now we have a

120
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,720
uh heathrow airport sitting in the cockpit of our plane and we're ready to to get going so let's keep

121
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:49,320
ready to to get going but before i do anything else let me show you the properties of the plane

122
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:56,200
which have also been greatly expanded and changed in version 3. and in that way it'll allow us to

123
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:02,120
see what kind of a beast we're actually even flying combo box pilot lucas hospital one

124
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:08,120
collapsed so i've opened them with the control enter keystroke and the very first line tells

125
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:15,480
me my name and my uh career level which is one for the time being so i'm actually still in training

126
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:22,920
that's why i don't have the qualification for the 787 to be able to fly it uh like uh in of my own

127
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:30,840
fleet skfre 696 free flight that's our call sign that will be used that the towers the controls

128
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:37,480
will use when uh contacting us over the radio to to refer to us and uh we can hear that it's a free

129
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:37,800
flight

130
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:44,520
boeing 787 dreamliner this is the name of the plane obviously transport plane jet plane three

131
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:51,320
rented it's a transport plane so it's not not it's not like a military plane it's a jet plane

132
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:57,800
that's talking about its propulsion it's category three meaning the largest possible uh type of

133
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:04,120
plane and it's currently rented so it's not my own certified one more reason for me to be really

134
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,040
careful because i don't want to smash it into the ground certified that means that

135
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:16,760
it's a plane which is a part of the official company fleet of eurofly and all pilots are

136
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:23,880
eligible to to use it for flights and to be ranked pushback required because this is a

137
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:30,600
large plane this is one of the new systems the first one it requires pushback meaning

138
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:38,120
planes cannot actually travel in reverse on their own uh not to mention such large planes so if i if i

139
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:47,000
drive into the gate for instance to pick up my passengers and i either need to get out of the gate

140
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:54,600
and continue going to my takeoff runway that i've been assigned by the tower i can't do that on my

141
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:01,880
own uh using the power of my own engines so the airport has i have to call the tower and ask them

142
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,160
to push me back to to send me the pushback tractor which is going to take me to the

143
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:15,240
to do it that's why i need to have when i'm flying such a large plane i also need to have

144
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:22,520
a large enough airport in this case it means i need an airport of category 3 for a plane of

145
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:29,400
category 3 also with the maintenance services like this like pushback to be able to take off

146
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:36,120
there and to be able to move on the airport with this plane condition 100 condition 100

147
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:42,280
this is another new feature in version 2 you may have been used to planes always being you know

148
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:48,680
in top shape and perfect working order and that that's not that's not no longer going to be the

149
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:57,240
case here um planes can get uh or various systems of the plane can get broken if we crash or if we

150
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:04,360
but it has to be just a minor crash while moving on the ground slowly and like crashing into a

151
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,040
building so we can break our

152
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:12,600
our lights or our onboard computer or other systems and then we'll need to ask the tower

153
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:21,320
for repairs uh but it can also happen just as the planes age and wear down over time you know so

154
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:27,560
last system check none the next line tells us that we haven't performed the system check uh

155
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:35,960
not even once yet number of c but if we have uh had done it which i'm going to do now i'm

156
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:41,080
going to leave the close the properties dialog with escape dashboard window and i'm going to

157
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:51,080
press ctrl shift uh z on the english keyboard yeah to perform the check starting system check

158
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:59,960
and if i now open the properties again certified condition 100 less system check just now just now

159
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,640
system check all systems are working correctly and we see that all systems are working correctly

160
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,240
number of seats 289.

161
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,960
essentially the tech spec sheet for the plane obviously it's going to be different for each

162
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:18,760
plane so we have a 289 seat number of passengers zero total obviously we don't have any passengers

163
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:26,760
on board at the moment wingspan 60m length 62m where is 62 meters long wingspan 60m oh so this

164
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:32,600
is actually quite interesting and i've never noticed it before but our wingspan is uh just

165
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,720
almost almost as much only two meters uh fewer

166
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:42,600
than the length of the plane 60 base weight 200t the base weight is 200 tons which is quite a lot

167
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:49,000
current weight 200 comma zero t and since we don't have any fuel as we've as we'll find out shortly

168
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,640
and no passengers either our current weight is still the same as the base weight but obviously

169
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:01,480
it can change with depending on how much fuel we load or how many passengers we board cruising

170
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,960
speed 955 kilometers this is the maximum declared uh

171
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:12,520
speed at which we'll be able to fly maximum cruising range 15 750 kilometers if we had our

172
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:20,600
full fuel tank completely full this is how far we would be able to travel in one flight uh uh in one

173
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:29,240
go uh at the most maximum cruising altitude 13 100 m so we can't fly any higher than a 13 100 meters

174
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:36,040
above the ground to to be safe and to avoid any damage of the engines flat positions zero slash six

175
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,880
and this is another new feature in version three flat positions

176
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:48,280
um you you heard that it's at zero slash six meaning they're currently set to zero out of six

177
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:57,720
possible um positions or uh levels and we can either erase the flaps upwards which is used

178
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:04,600
uh for taking off or downwards which is obviously used for landing so the planes the flaps are there

179
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:13,560
airborne even at low speeds uh in any case but the difference is obviously that if the play if the

180
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:20,280
flaps are raised upwards um it helps us to uh get up get out get away from the ground and lift uh

181
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:29,240
raise our nose and if it if they're um set downwards for landing it helps us to break faster

182
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:36,120
after landing base takeoff speed 260 kilometers base landing speed 260 kilometers

183
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,640
180 kilometers current stall speed 380 kilometers we really have to watch these speeds especially

184
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:48,360
all the current ones very carefully all the time during flight or until we get to know the plane by

185
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:55,000
heart and we're really confident about all its parameters because the base takeoff and landing

186
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,400
speeds again will be different depending on how much fuel and how many passengers we have

187
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:05,480
and the same um the basic the base stall speed is always the same but it says current

188
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:12,360
because the stall speed changes uh depending on the flaps that i was talking about before

189
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:18,920
so current takeoff speed 260 kilometers currently with an empty tank and with an empty cabin with no

190
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:24,120
passengers we would be able to theoretically be able to take off at 260 kilometers per hour

191
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:29,640
take off nose angle 6 to 11 17. minimum flap position while taking off two but we would have

192
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:35,960
to set the flaps upwards to position two for that at least two we could uh set them even

193
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:41,560
higher but the minimum required for a successful takeoff is two take off nose angle six to eleven

194
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:48,840
seventeen and we would have to raise the nose uh to an angle between six uh which is the minimum

195
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:56,360
the optimal angle is eleven and the maximum is seventeen for a successful takeoff if we raised

196
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:05,080
the nose higher than 17 degrees we would actually lose lift and stall minimum takeoff runway length

197
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:15,160
we also need a runway which is at least 2 700 meters long in order to be able to be able to

198
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:24,120
take off successfully to um gain enough speed for uh takeoff current landing speed 260 kilometers

199
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:35,160
and the current landing speed is also 260 kilometers um we can't land uh at a higher speed

200
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,120
than that if we land at a higher speed than that we can't land at a higher speed than that if we

201
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:41,320
were much higher speed by like more than 20 kilometers higher than that if we tried it

202
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:48,680
we would actually crash a crash and break on the ground on on contact with the ground minimum flap

203
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:55,080
position while landing four in order to be able to land successfully we have to have the flaps

204
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,320
set to four downwards minimum landing runway length one thousand eight hundred and seventy m

205
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:05,240
and the minimum landing runway length is actually shorter almost by a thousand meters shorter than

206
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:15,400
uh the minimum required runway length for takeoff because uh we will be having the flaps set to a

207
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:21,320
higher position for landing then we'll need to have them set for takeoff which means our

208
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:29,320
the length of runway that we're going to be able to break is going to be shorter for landing

209
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:35,880
but we need to keep watching the stealth the stall speed if you remember it said that our current

210
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:44,120
speed was 380 kilometers meaning we would actually stall and fall down to the ground much sooner

211
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:49,640
than we would be able to reach the required landing speed and that's why another reason

212
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:56,440
we need to use the flaps because when we retract them beyond zero in either direction the stall

213
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:05,800
speed um decreases because we're able to uh they're able to keep us airborne even at lower speeds

214
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:15,320
so the current stall speed of 380 kilometers would drop below the current takeoff or landing speed of

215
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:22,520
260 kilometers which is required fuel tank capacity 56 700 l current fuel load zero l currently we

216
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:27,160
don't have any fuel loaded current cruising range zero kilometers so we can't travel any distance

217
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:34,920
fuel used zero l haven't used any fuel yet either obviously battery off the battery is off the power

218
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:45,080
so another new feature in version 3 we can't actually do anything at all not even start

219
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:51,240
start the onboard computer or our radio or our transponder or any of the flights until we turn

220
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:57,160
on the battery or the power supply which which then provides the necessary power required to

221
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:05,800
start all the other systems including the engine off oh apu is another auxiliary power unit which

222
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:13,480
uh the larger planes have but the smaller ones don't the planes that have it need

223
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,200
to have the battery running as well in order to be able to start it because

224
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,480
we can't start any other systems including the apu including the engines without the

225
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,560
battery running but only if we have the battery running we can start the apu

226
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:35,960
which is already using our fuel supply a tiny bit and that's the system which

227
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:42,780
provides even more power than the battery, allowing us on these large Category 3 planes

228
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:49,220
to then finally start the engines, only once the APU is running.

229
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:53,800
We can see that both engines are off.

230
00:22:53,800 --> 00:23:00,980
This is talking about gears and we'll be talking about this in a much greater detail in the

231
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:11,880
upcoming series of audio tutorials on Eurofly 3, which the basic series includes 15 recordings

232
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:19,000
describing various aspects of the program and then there is an upcoming, more advanced

233
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:27,140
series that describes how to actually fly and control in even more detail all the nine

234
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,860
basic planes that are required to successfully go

235
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:30,960
to Europe.

236
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:45,860
But very briefly, the gears are talking about the power of our engines, how much power,

237
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:55,280
how much output they're currently producing and thus how much speed will be moving, but

238
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,840
they're not directly related.

239
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,840
In Eurofly 3, any speed or any movement...

240
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:09,840
You don't just press a key anymore and that sets your speed, but any speed or course

241
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:16,460
changes are only the result of moving of your engine power, of the engine output, or in

242
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:24,540
the case of turning or climbing or descending, the result of how steeply you bank your wings

243
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,860
or your wheels.

244
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,860
Think of it like a steering wheel in a car.

245
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,860
Which...

246
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,180
If you wanted to turn, for example, to the left, you would...

247
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:39,260
You wouldn't just tap the wheel, you know, just press an arrow key.

248
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:44,000
You would need to keep holding it under a certain angle in the direction that you wish

249
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,820
to turn for a while.

250
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,840
As long as you wanted to keep turning, you would need to keep holding it.

251
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:53,640
So if you wanted to turn, say, 90 degrees to the left, you would need to keep holding

252
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:59,140
it, pointing or turning to the left for a while and only after you've turned as much

253
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,140
as you wanted.

254
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:05,100
If you are now satisfied with your current direction of travel, you could let go of the

255
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,900
wheel and keep going straight from that point on.

256
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,260
And the engine works pretty much the same.

257
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,340
You are moving a lever, essentially.

258
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,500
The result of the...

259
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:24,580
Or how much power the engines will be running on depends on how far or how high up you've

260
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,760
moved the lever.

261
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,040
Which obviously can be moved between...

262
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
Um...

263
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,420
Zero and one hundred percent.

264
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:38,220
One hundred is full power, zero is nothing at all.

265
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:43,820
But even if you set it to one hundred, it'll take the engines a while to actually reach

266
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,000
that full power.

267
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,880
You know, to accelerate.

268
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,300
Not to mention there's two modes of flight.

269
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:57,980
There's actual flight mode, but there's also the taxi mode for large planes like this one,

270
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,100
which are capable of the...

271
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,100
Of maximum speed.

272
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:04,940
Maximum cruising speeds above five hundred kilometers per hour.

273
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:09,720
And the taxi mode is used with these planes while moving along the airport.

274
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,320
Because we don't want to set the engine power to full...

275
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,320
Um...

276
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:20,980
Yeah, the engines to full power and start going like a hundred or two hundred and more

277
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,820
kilometers per hour while on the ground, while on the airport.

278
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:29,980
So if we turn on taxi mode, that will actually make the...

279
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,980
The lever...

280
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,980
Just the power lever adjustments much more fine.

281
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:41,920
So that even if we set the power lever to a hundred in taxi mode, it will actually only

282
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,920
be...

283
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,920
Um...

284
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:50,460
The resulting power will only be ten percent of the maximum available possible power of

285
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,760
the engines.

286
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,300
So only a tenth of the engine's maximum power.

287
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,300
Of the...

288
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,300
Of the...

289
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,300
Um...

290
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,300
Possible one hundred.

291
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,180
Uh...

292
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:03,120
And in order to get the full power out of the engines, we would need to switch back

293
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,960
to flight mode.

294
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,900
So as soon as we're about to take off, we'll be switching from taxi mode to flight mode.

295
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,900
And the gears...

296
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:18,100
You don't have to press home or end a hundred times to, uh...

297
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,800
You know, move the lever all the way from zero to one hundred.

298
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:28,120
There are keystrokes either to set maximum power for the given mode or minimum power,

299
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,120
with a single keystroke.

300
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:37,960
Or there is another set of keystrokes to quickly move the power by ten percent, up or down.

301
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:43,500
Or there's a third set of keystrokes, which allows you to set the...

302
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,720
The specific gear.

303
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,800
Pretty much like shifting gears up or down in a car.

304
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,480
And the...

305
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,840
These plane properties here, this sheet, uh...

306
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,900
Tells us exactly...

307
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,900
What...

308
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:06,700
What percentage of the maximum possible power we'll be able to reach, and on any one of

309
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,700
these gears.

310
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,700
Engine.

311
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,700
Engine one.

312
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,700
Off.

313
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,700
Engine.

314
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,700
Gear one.

315
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,700
Zero comma one percent.

316
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,700
Two comma four percent.

317
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,700
Gear two.

318
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,700
Two comma five percent.

319
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,700
Four comma nine percent.

320
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,700
Gear three.

321
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,700
Five percent.

322
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,700
Seven comma four percent.

323
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,700
Gear four.

324
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,700
Seven comma five percent.

325
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,700
Nine comma nine percent.

326
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,700
Gear five.

327
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,700
Ten percent.

328
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,700
Ten percent.

329
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,900
So, uh...

330
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,900
As you could hear, gear, uh...

331
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,900
One...

332
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,900
Gear one.

333
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,900
Engine two.

334
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,900
Started at, like, zero point something percent.

335
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,900
And ends at...

336
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,900
Engine.

337
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,900
Gear one.

338
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,900
Zero comma one percent.

339
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,900
Two comma four percent.

340
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,900
Two point four percent, which is barely enough to even start moving.

341
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:52,900
And gear five actually does not end all the way at one hundred, but it only goes up to

342
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,900
ten.

343
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,700
And that's exactly because of the taxi mode.

344
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,700
Once I switch to flight mode, the gear...

345
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,700
The percentages that we're able...

346
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,700
The power...

347
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,700
The percentages of the maximum power that we'll be able to reach for each gear will

348
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,700
change.

349
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,700
And, uh...

350
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,700
Gear five will let us go all the way up to one hundred.

351
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,700
But, by the way, it's never healthy and advisable to fly, uh, with the very full power with

352
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,700
one hundred.

353
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,700
For any engine.

354
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,700
Uh, so if we want to avoid, uh, engine damage, we should only be flying at ninety percent

355
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,700
of the time.

356
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,700
So, uh...

357
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,700
Uh...

358
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,700
So, uh...

359
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,700
So, uh...

360
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,700
So, uh...

361
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,700
So, uh...

362
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,700
So, uh...

363
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,700
So, uh...

364
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,700
So, uh...

365
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,700
So, uh...

366
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,700
So, uh...

367
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,700
So, uh...

368
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,700
So, uh...

369
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,700
So, uh...

370
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,700
So, uh...

371
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,700
So, uh...

372
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,700
So, uh...

373
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,700
So, uh...

374
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,700
So, uh...

375
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,700
So, uh...

376
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,700
So, uh...

377
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,700
So, uh...

378
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,700
So, uh...

379
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,700
So, uh...

380
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,700
So, uh...

381
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,700
So, uh...

382
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,700
So, uh...

383
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,700
So, uh...

384
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,700
So, uh...

385
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,700
So, uh...

386
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,700
So, uh...

387
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,700
So, uh...

388
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,700
So, uh...

389
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,700
So, uh...

390
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,700
So, uh...

391
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,700
So, uh...

392
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,700
So, uh...

393
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,700
So, uh...

394
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,700
So, uh...

395
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,700
So, uh...

396
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,700
So, uh...

397
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,700
So, uh...

398
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,700
So, uh...

399
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,700
So, uh...

400
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,700
So, uh...

401
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,700
So, uh...

402
00:29:54,700 --> 00:30:05,360
you don't only need to use you don't only have in you you have more options than just using the

403
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:12,500
the ground brake after landing but you can also engage the reverse thrust to brake even faster

404
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:19,780
using the power of the engine but in that case remember that if you want to brake harder you

405
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:28,360
would actually have to increase the power in reverse thrust mode because the power of the

406
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:34,960
engine is going backwards but you still need more power to brake harder if that makes sense doors

407
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,960
closed cockpit open yeah our doors closed the cabin doors but our cockpit is open seat belt

408
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,060
unfastened we haven't even fastened our seat belt yet parking brakes active parking brakes uh i

409
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,740
think there are they are also a new system

410
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:54,500
as long as they're engaged we cannot move and this is a safety feature to make sure you don't

411
00:30:54,500 --> 00:31:02,080
like drift along the runway while you're not yet ready to do so you're you're uh creating your

412
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,860
flight plan or boarding passengers or something landing gear you don't want to move you don't

413
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:13,020
want to move uh on your own or the plane to move by itself landing gear the landing gear is lowered

414
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:18,060
which means it's okay because and it has to be obviously when we're standing parked in the in

415
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:18,480
the hangar

416
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:25,300
uh so we're it we're ready for takeoff or for landing we've landed before so we're we're now

417
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:31,340
sitting on our wheels current flap position zero yeah the current flap position is zero we haven't

418
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:36,060
used them yet onboard computer off radio off these are the individual systems transponder off

419
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:41,520
communicator off of the plane which all of which are still off atlas off sensor off status monitor

420
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:46,600
off because we don't even have any power taxi lights off yet to turn them on cabin lights off

421
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,400
the lights strobe lights off

422
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:55,940
are a new thing in version three as well uh cabin taxi lights off these we need to have uh turned on

423
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:01,300
when we're taxiing on the airport so that the ground personnel and other taxiing planes can

424
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:06,420
see us cabin lights off these are the lights for the passengers so that they don't have to

425
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:13,060
uh spend all the duration of the flight sitting uh in their seats in the dark strobe lights off

426
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:18,660
strobe lights uh these are uh these make the plane visible visible from the outside

427
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:26,820
also to ground personnel but also in the air and to like passengers who are who are about to board it

428
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:32,600
and they're coming over to the gate or stand where we're sitting waiting for them so that they can see

429
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:38,840
which plane it is landing lights off and these are only used when we're about to land and slow

430
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:45,740
down and descend to reach the take the landing runway ventilation off ventilation cabin

431
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,500
pressurization off and cabin press pressurization off ventilation off and cabin pressurization off

432
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:55,380
are two new systems which also have to be on at all times during the flight which

433
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:03,620
take care of producing enough oxygens for the passengers not to suffocate in a higher altitude

434
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:08,260
temperature control off temperature control takes care of the weather obviously

435
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:18,100
so that the passengers don't like freeze or overheat during the flight storm radar off storm

436
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:27,700
when on can warn us of incoming or nearby storms tk off tcas is the system that warns planes that

437
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:38,180
are headed on uh perpendicular courses and are about to crash into each other so usually the

438
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:45,940
the tcas of one plane orders the pilot to climb while the system of the other plane orders their

439
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,180
pilot to descend

440
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:56,660
off to avoid the crash stall indication is another warning system that will warn us if our cruising

441
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:03,380
speed drops dangerously low and we've actually reached the stall speed the current stall speed

442
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:08,500
of the plane depending on the position of the flaps and we're just we're losing lift and we're

443
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:18,260
losing altitude gpws off gpws i believe it stands for ground proximity warning system and it's that's

444
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:27,780
what it does because in Eurofly 3 we also have to keep track and pay attention to yet another thing

445
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:34,080
and that is the terrain the elevation of the terrain in front of us because you know the map

446
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:41,760
well the map on a map on paper would be but the actual real world terrain is not flat

447
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:47,800
it's actually 3d so there are hills and mountains and ridges and valleys and all of that

448
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:54,060
cause the elevation or the height above sea level of the terrain below us to keep changing

449
00:34:54,060 --> 00:35:04,040
to keep going up and down as we fly so we need to keep track of the of whether there's any hill

450
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:10,160
or mountain or any obstacle ahead of us with a higher with a greater height above sea level than

451
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:16,760
what our current altitude is and if there is we need to climb higher to avoid to avoid crashing

452
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,240
into it.

453
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:24,560
And the larger planes like this one have the system which warns us about this by itself

454
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:32,560
so it tells us to climb to avoid collision with the ground or to change course but on a smaller

455
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:38,560
simpler planes of category one without these automated systems we have to keep track of all that manually.

456
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,960
Bank angle indication on.

457
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:47,640
Bank angle indication is an audio cue that plays all the time when we're turning so

458
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:47,760
Bank angle indication is an audio cue that plays all the time when we're turning so

459
00:35:47,800 --> 00:36:00,200
as I was saying before when our wings or wheels are banked to an angle causing us to to turn to change course so that we know we know we're actually turning we're not level we're not going straight.

460
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,040
Bank angle indication is an audio cue that plays all the time when we're turning so that we know we're not level we're not going straight.

461
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:08,740
And that this also is true this is also true for the nose if our nose is not straight we're also hearing this indication.

462
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,300
Audio navigation off.

463
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,700
Audio navigation I believe this is familiar.

464
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:17,640
We can have this on during flight to keep hearing.

465
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:31,380
A continuous tone at all times from the direction of our destination so that we can tell even by sound alone in which direction to go and where to turn in order to to be flying straight towards our destination.

466
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,780
Auto navigation off.

467
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:42,840
Auto navigation that's essentially the autopilot or all of these remaining systems are part of the autopilot which.

468
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:47,480
This one makes sure if enabled that the plane will always change.

469
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,540
Its course by itself to keep flying straight towards the destination at all times.

470
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,480
Auto speed inactive.

471
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,980
Auto speed we can.

472
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:00,420
Set the plane to speed up or slow down to any required speed that we want.

473
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,420
Auto course inactive.

474
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:10,080
Auto course we don't have to use the auto navigation to the destination that we have set before but we can also set the plane to go.

475
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:15,620
In any specific course that we desire which may not have to be the destination.

476
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,220
I'll show you this feature in.

477
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:30,160
In practice and how useful it is when I'm about to land auto altitude inactive in auto altitude we can also obviously excuse me set the altitude and we want to be flying in.

478
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,320
Okay.

479
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:40,320
These are the dashboard properties but we need to get moving don't we so let's let's actually start doing something.

480
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,280
Let me turn on the battery first.

481
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,280
Control shift B.

482
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,880
Because as I as I was saying before.

483
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,220
Without.

484
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:51,620
The battery I wouldn't even be able to turn on the onboard computer or any other systems.

485
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,520
Now let me turn on the.

486
00:37:53,520 --> 00:38:02,820
Computer control shift K computer on warning fuel warning and we are hearing that we are out of fuel warning computer off so let me turn it off.

487
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:08,120
Just for now because that warning that looping warning is kind of annoying.

488
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:16,580
And let me fix that with smaller planes you can just you as the pilot can just just.

489
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:16,880
Poor.

490
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,780
Or the required amount of fuel in yourself.

491
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:29,220
But for larger planes like this we need to use the radio for this and we need to contact the tower and ask them to dispatch the refueler for us.

492
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:34,720
So let me turn on the radio control shift F radio on.

493
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:45,280
And let me find out the frequencies of all the possible towers or controls in range that I'm currently able to connect to.

494
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,040
We use the.

495
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:46,240
The.

496
00:38:46,240 --> 00:39:13,980
Key nine on the numbers row for that combo box London Heathrow ground control one eighteen comma five collapsed and we can hear that there is a ground control London Heathrow approach control one thirteen comma eight and approach control the ground control obviously controls the planes that are taxiing along the airport while the approach control is for planes that are flying towards the airport and are about to land on it as well as for planes.

497
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,900
Once you've been assigned.

498
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:20,400
The runway to take off from and you're about to enter that runway.

499
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:31,200
That's when you switch your frequency from ground control to approach control and start talking to them and get the permission to enter the runway and then to take off from approach.

500
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,900
But for now let's London Heathrow ground control one eighteen comma five.

501
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:44,000
Let's dashboard window talk to ground control set frequency set frequency and we have to set frequency one one three point.

502
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,740
Five I believe it was one thirteen.

503
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:52,600
Comma five dashboard window set for one one three point six blank one thirteen comma six dash one thirteen comma six.

504
00:39:52,600 --> 00:40:01,640
What was the combo box London Heathrow ground control one eighteen comma five collapse all white one eighteen point five my bad sorry one one eight point five London.

505
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,980
Ski for ground control dashboard six welcome to our airport.

506
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:11,800
The tower has welcomed us as we can hear well in my voice again but never mind.

507
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,640
No no other English towers yet.

508
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,640
That will be.

509
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,880
Up to you to change that.

510
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:30,480
In version three the towers are no longer static we actually talk to them we have to ask various permissions from them depending on what we're currently doing.

511
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,740
In our flight.

512
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:42,280
And you always do that by pressing F one combo box board asking for boarding collapsed and here you can see a list of all the possible requests that you can.

513
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,740
Make.

514
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,640
To the tower at the moment so.

515
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:54,340
For instance wouldn't make any sense to ask the ground control for landing clearance when we're not even in air not even flying.

516
00:40:54,340 --> 00:41:00,880
So that's why you can't see that request here but you will see it in here in the list when flying and when.

517
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,880
Tuned to the approach frequency engines asking for permission to start the engines fuel asking for fuel gate asking for date assignment plan I want to create a flight plan push I need pushback repair I need repairs.

518
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:21,140
Runway asking for runway assignment on board asking for onboarding.

519
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,480
If I.

520
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:32,140
Tried to ask for onboarding for example at the moment you know I don't even have a flight plan created I don't I don't have any passengers on board.

521
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:39,640
At anything so the tower is context sensitive and smart so it won't let me do an obvious nonsense like that.

522
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:44,140
Dashboard window six nine six we haven't received any flight plan from you.

523
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,340
Now I'm about to fix that shortly.

524
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:51,840
Thank you but first combo give me some fuel fuel asking for fuel set fuel amount at a blank.

525
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,840
Two thousand.

526
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:58,140
Let me do two thousand liters I don't know how much that would be in gallons but that's going to be.

527
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:02,140
More than enough for us to make that whole flight successfully.

528
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:02,640
Two thousand.

529
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,140
Yes.

530
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:09,140
Six nine six we've dispatched the refueler for you.

531
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,140
Before the refueler arrives.

532
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,840
Let us do some more.

533
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,640
Things.

534
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,140
Some more.

535
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:15,340
Preparations.

536
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:18,340
From the checklist ahead of time.

537
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:22,840
So let's fasten our seat belt with control B.

538
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,840
Seat belt fastened.

539
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:32,840
We have already performed the system check but let's also turn on the systems that we can at the moment even without the APU and without the engines running.

540
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:38,340
Just the just those ones that we have enough power for even on battery alone.

541
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:45,140
So storm radar control shift s storm radar on strobe lights the outside lights shift.

542
00:42:45,140 --> 00:43:03,140
S cabin lights on cabin lights sorry strobe lights are shift D strobe lights on taxi lights will also be needing them shift K taxi lights on let's turn on the transponder which will use shortly with control shift T transponder on.

543
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:14,940
And we can also turn on the atlas control shift L atlas on and communicator control shift G communicator on and the refuelers come so we can already start.

544
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:21,140
The turn on the onboard computer as well with control shift K computer on this time for good.

545
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:25,340
Because we will not be needing to turn it off anymore.

546
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,840
We won't be hearing the annoying warning anymore.

547
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:31,740
And now that everything's been done and we've been refueled.

548
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,140
Let's check out.

549
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:37,140
Check out our fuel load with E 2000 L.

550
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,540
Exactly as we requested.

551
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:44,540
So let's turn on the APU now with control page up.

552
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:44,740
And that's good.

553
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:52,140
That's going to give us enough power when it starts up finally to to turn on the engines.

554
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:54,740
By the way the atlas is just another panel.

555
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:59,540
If you have it turned on you can move with the tab key.

556
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:14,340
So you don't only have to be on the dashboard controlling the plane but you can press tab navigation atlas window to get to the atlas window and you can use the keystrokes that you would otherwise use in the manual world map exploration mode.

557
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:40,340
So as you're flying without needing to leave your plane you can check anything that you need to on the atlas communicator channel 0 and the communicator box collapsed would let you chat to or send audio messages voice messages to other pilots to other actual real life players that are currently online and connected to the server and playing Eurofly alongside you dashboard window the APU is on.

558
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:44,140
So let's turn on the other systems that we'll be needing for.

559
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,540
For the flight that I was talking about.

560
00:44:46,540 --> 00:45:13,740
Let's do TCAS on TCAS with control shift C stall indication stall indication control shift E temperature control control shift you temperature control on ventilation control shift ventilation on cabin pressurization control shift P cabin pressurization WS the one which warns us not to crash into the ground control shift.

561
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:37,340
W GP WS on and let's also turn on the sensor with control backspace sensor on I forgot to mention that before that's another new system where if you're moving on a taxiway or runway it it'll indicate audibly that there's an obstacle ahead of you or off to the side or that you're about to leave the runway.

562
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:41,140
Let's ask the tower.

563
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,140
Let's ask the tower.

564
00:45:43,740 --> 00:46:11,740
Let's ask the tower for permission to start our engines because with large planes like this one you can't just turn on the engines anytime you want because they produce a lot of noise and a lot of airflow and you wouldn't want to say knock a random innocent ground control personnel away or something so let's ask for the permission engines asking for permission to start the engines dashboard window six nine six you have permission to start the engines.

565
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:12,740
Thank you.

566
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:13,740
Start engines.

567
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:41,740
Engine one with page up starting engine two with page down starting and you can hear that each of them is playing from a different place in the stereo field engine one is on the left engine two is on the right since it takes a lot of time for the engines to actually start up but this is something seasoned players of your flight to will have known will be told with a voice prompt as well as soon as the engines are done actually starting up.

568
00:46:43,740 --> 00:47:11,740
Let's find out where we're located West S course we're facing West minus 500 hangar two we're in the hangar two with the K 300 hangar two and L keys these two tell us our coordinates on the airport K says announces the north south coordinate so from bottom to top if you were to take at the entire airport as a flat surface as a flat area as though yeah on a painted on a sheet of paper.

569
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,740
The.

570
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:20,740
Lowest number of the first number would be.

571
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:34,740
All the way down to the south in the in the lower corner and the higher numbers would be all the way up in the upper part or upper on the upper edge minus 500 hangar two so it since it says minus 500.

572
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:42,740
We can tell that we are at the very south edge of the airport and the L key does the same but for.

573
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:43,740
The.

574
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:59,740
West east or left to right coordinate so the higher the number the farther off to the right we are on the map or in the area of the airport 300 hangar two 300 that's also pretty.

575
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:12,740
Far to the west or to the left because the maximum coordinate would be like 200 2600 or 3000 or something and since we are we know we are in the hangar which we can also.

576
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:17,740
Verify with the okey hangar doors closed west.

577
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:24,740
It says that the hangar doors are closed so let's open it with shift o.

578
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:36,740
So that we don't you know so that so that we don't crash into the doors as we try to pick up some speed and drive off the hangar.

579
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:40,740
Let's also find our doors are high above sea level while we're at it.

580
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:41,740
That's done.

581
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:42,740
Okay.

582
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,740
That's done with the semi colon key 16.

583
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:50,740
So this airport is actually only 16 meters above sea level or above.

584
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:51,740
Yeah.

585
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:54,740
Above sea level.

586
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:55,740
Airport London Heathrow.

587
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:56,740
Yeah.

588
00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:05,740
We can find out with F 118 comma 5 London Heathrow ground control our frequency and it says that we're properly connected to the London Heathrow ground control.

589
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:10,740
So we should be ready our engines are running.

590
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:11,740
Let's.

591
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:16,740
Disengage the parking brakes with B so that we can actually start moving.

592
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:17,740
Parking brakes off.

593
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:25,740
Let's ask the tower to assign us a gate or stand to taxi to where we'll be picking up our passengers.

594
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:29,740
Combo gate asking for gate assignment dashboard 696.

595
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:34,740
We haven't received any flight plan from you and I have completely forgotten to create my flight plan.

596
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:35,740
My bad.

597
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,740
I was saying before that I'm about to fix it.

598
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:39,740
Well let's do that now.

599
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:45,740
First I'm going to pick my destination where I want to fly because I believe that's the faster and easier way to do it.

600
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:50,740
So let's display the list of all the available airports.

601
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:52,740
There are several different ways.

602
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:59,740
You may know them from previous versions but I'm in this case I'm going to use the list ordered by distance from closest to farthest.

603
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:01,740
So I'm going to press control F 8.

604
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,740
Combo box England London.

605
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:04,740
England France.

606
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:08,740
Let's choose England Manchester and let's add it as our destination.

607
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:13,740
Add destination to navigation with space.

608
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:21,740
Let's leave this dialog and let's now ask the tower with F1 to create a flight plan.

609
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:31,740
We can see our call sign here but you can see that this is a read only edit field so we can't change the call sign at any time during the flight.

610
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:37,740
And since I just chose the destination before and added it to my navigation it's already pre-filled in here for us.

611
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:40,740
So another press of the tab key.

612
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:49,740
There's the filter if I wanted to if I didn't hadn't done this before and I now had to choose my destination manually and there would be like thousands of airports.

613
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:53,740
I could filter or narrow my search down here using the filter field.

614
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:55,740
Flight description edit blank.

615
00:50:55,740 --> 00:51:03,740
There's a flight description field where other players could see like what this flight is actually about.

616
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:07,740
If they were checking the other players that are currently there.

617
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:11,740
So let's put in something here.

618
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:25,740
Sounds good to me.

619
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:27,740
Asking for a navigated flight.

620
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:33,740
That would be a flight corridor that the tower would create for us.

621
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:35,740
For long distance flights like this one.

622
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:42,740
Planes don't usually fly in a straight line directly to their destination.

623
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:48,740
But they're flying over designated flyover points.

624
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:51,740
But I'm actually going to ask for a direct flight this time.

625
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:53,740
Direct flight.

626
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:54,740
We could also do.

627
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:55,740
Flight corridor through my waypoints.

628
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,740
Flight corridor through my waypoints.

629
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:03,740
So not a flight corridor that the control tower would determine for us.

630
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:15,740
But rather let's say that I wanted to fly to Manchester then to Birmingham and then back to Heathrow.

631
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:17,740
All in one flight.

632
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:22,740
So what I could do is I could put all these three destinations into my navigation.

633
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,740
Excuse me.

634
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:27,740
In the order that I want to fly through them.

635
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:29,740
And if I then chose this option.

636
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:31,740
Flight corridor through my waypoints.

637
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:32,740
When creating my flight plan.

638
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:36,740
That's what the flight corridor would be.

639
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:37,740
Direct flight.

640
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:38,740
But let's ask for direct flight.

641
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:40,740
Another press of tab.

642
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,740
My waypoints combo box Manchester collapsed.

643
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:45,740
My waypoints only include Manchester the destination for now.

644
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:47,740
So that's in order.

645
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:48,740
Passengers checkbox not checked.

646
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,740
And there's the checkbox for passengers.

647
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:52,740
Yes I do want to have passengers.

648
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,740
So I'm going to check it.

649
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:55,740
Ask for flight button.

650
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:57,740
And there's the ask for flight button.

651
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:58,740
Dashboard window.

652
00:52:58,740 --> 00:52:59,740
SK696.

653
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:01,740
Flight plan accepted.

654
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:02,740
Set transponder.

655
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,740
To 1517.

656
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:06,740
Our flight plan has been accepted.

657
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:08,740
We're supposed to set the transponder now.

658
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,740
I can either repeat.

659
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:11,740
If I forget.

660
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:14,740
I can either repeat the last tower announcement with space.

661
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:15,740
SK696.

662
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:16,740
At any time.

663
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:17,740
Flight plan accepted.

664
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:18,740
Set transponder.

665
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,740
To 1517.

666
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:21,740
Or I can also press.

667
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,740
In this case.

668
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:24,740
I can also just press shift T.

669
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:25,740
For transponder.

670
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:28,740
To hear just the value that's been assigned to us.

671
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:29,740
1517.

672
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:31,740
SKFRE 696 London.

673
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:32,740
Manchester.

674
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:33,740
So.

675
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:34,740
It's 1517.

676
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:35,740
1517.

677
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:36,740
Yes.

678
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:39,740
So let's press alt T to set the code.

679
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:40,740
Set transponder value.

680
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:41,740
Set.

681
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:42,740
1517.

682
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:43,740
1517.

683
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:44,740
Dashboard window.

684
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:47,740
Now the tower should finally allow us to start our engines.

685
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:48,740
Engines.

686
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:50,740
Asking for permission to start the engines.

687
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:51,740
Dashboard window.

688
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:52,740
SK696.

689
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:55,740
You have permission to start the engines.

690
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:56,740
Oh wait.

691
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:57,740
But they're already.

692
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:58,740
They're already running right?

693
00:53:58,740 --> 00:53:59,740
Engine 1.

694
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:00,740
0.

695
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:01,740
Engine 2.

696
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:02,740
0.

697
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:03,740
That's just the APU.

698
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:04,740
Okay.

699
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:05,740
So.

700
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:06,740
Stopping.

701
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:07,740
Stopping.

702
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:08,740
Oh no.

703
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:09,740
They were running.

704
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:10,740
I'm stupid.

705
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,740
Zero means.

706
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:12,740
Yeah.

707
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:13,740
The power.

708
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:14,740
They were not.

709
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:15,740
Um.

710
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:16,740
Producing any output.

711
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:17,740
Any thrust.

712
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:18,740
So that's why.

713
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:19,740
Done.

714
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:20,740
That's why.

715
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:21,740
Done.

716
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:22,740
They were at zero.

717
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:23,740
So again.

718
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:24,740
But we did get the permission though.

719
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:25,740
Never mind.

720
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:26,740
We got it a second time even.

721
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:27,740
So let's just restart them again.

722
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:28,740
Starting.

723
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:29,740
Starting.

724
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:30,740
I have a flight plan.

725
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:32,900
And couldn't do because I didn't have any plan.

726
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:35,240
So I just remembered now.

727
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:40,280
Was actually to ask for the gate or stand to pick up passengers.

728
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,280
Combo.

729
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,280
Gate.

730
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,280
Asking.

731
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,280
Dashboard window.

732
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,280
SSK 696.

733
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,280
Taxi to stand 5.

734
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,280
Taxi to stand 5.

735
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:54,680
The difference between a gate or stand is that the stand is like a drive through.

736
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:57,740
You can drive through it in any direction.

737
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:58,740
And.

738
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:07,840
and stop there and if you if you've entered the stand say coming from the

739
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:14,580
south so facing north you could then keep going on in the same direction keep

740
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:19,080
going north and drive through it and leave it at the other side where is a

741
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:26,620
gate is an extension for of the actual airport building so that's why you have

742
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:30,640
to use a push back to get out of a gate you can't just keep going straight

743
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:35,560
because you would then crash into the airport building okay so we're supposed

744
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:42,100
to taxi to stand one so we can start moving we are now in the hangar minus

745
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:47,560
500 hangar to 300 hangar to hangar doors open West we the doors are open so I

746
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:53,180
believe we're ready we've done everything so I'm going to press alt home

747
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:56,620
to set the engine power to the maximum

748
00:55:56,620 --> 00:56:00,880
but remember it's only going to be 10% of the overall engine power because we

749
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:07,600
are currently in taxi mode gear 5 gear 5 3 keep checking my six print speed with

750
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:13,480
our 12 14 once it gets it to 17 19 20 I'm going to choke it with control

751
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:19,300
delete 21 fix it so that it doesn't 21 like doesn't drop any further 200 and

752
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:26,020
750 we're now on the mic 304 tax on the mic

753
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:37,600
which is 338 349 which goes from zero seven seven seven seven six five five

754
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:45,100
four three three from the hangars one one zero north from the hangars and we

755
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:50,520
were we left the hangar facing west but this is a so north-south taxiway so we

756
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:56,560
had to turn 90 degrees to the right to be facing north now and keep driving a

757
00:56:56,620 --> 00:57:04,720
long mic facing north and it'll lead us to the turning which leads to the taxiway

758
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:10,600
called Zulu and this is the one that leads to north to the stands so we'll be

759
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:14,200
facing uh East I believe

760
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:24,040
we can bank the wheels with by up to 50 degrees so that means how sharply we'll

761
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,560
be turning and you do that with either left or right obviously

762
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:33,100
or with shift left and shift right arrow key for 10 degrees of the wheel

763
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:38,320
inclination for with each press so I just pressed shift right five times to

764
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:43,420
bank the wheels by 50 degrees and I'm listening to this one this sound tells

765
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:56,560
me each 10 degrees that I've turned so 80 90. press G key quickly to level my twice quickly to level my

766
00:57:56,620 --> 00:58:01,360
a taxi to stand five to level my plane 23.

767
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:07,480
set flat position six dashboard window I'm actually supposed to it helps to

768
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:17,440
extend the flaps down even when I'm just going difficult songs because that helps

769
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:24,340
to break faster so that's what I'm doing so we're just traveling East along Zulu we can hear the

770
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:25,840
stand one turning

771
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:33,580
left and I'll slow down to 10 once we are driving by stand 4 so that I then

772
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:39,160
have enough time and enough room to turn sharply to the west to the north to turn

773
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:47,320
sharply by 90 degrees then to be facing stand 5 again the layout of the airport

774
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:54,160
is something that you can read and learn in the airport descriptions airport

775
00:58:54,160 --> 00:59:00,040
properties with shift enter and what I'll be demonstrating in a bit when we

776
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:04,340
are flying stand 4 so I'm slowing down alt end to 21 flaps extended

777
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:08,080
downwards to 6 set the engines to 0 19 flaps extended downwards watching my

778
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:11,860
speed with R 17 flaps extended downwards to 6 to choke it off again with control

779
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:17,200
delete once it reaches 10 14 flaps extend 13 flaps extend 13 flaps extend 12 flaps extend 12

780
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:23,780
11 11 11 11 10 flaps choked off gear 1 and once I start hearing the beacon now

781
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:24,160
I

782
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:30,040
force the and 5 let's just press shift 5 left many times and turn 90 degrees to

783
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:38,920
the left 20 30 and the other higher sharper sound that's the bank angle

784
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:49,000
indication so that tells us that we're actually turning right now stand 5 stand

785
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:54,040
5 here 0 6 4 3 3 2 1

786
00:59:54,540 --> 01:00:01,780
breaking breaking breaking by holding down the slash key to stand still so I'm

787
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:09,780
now facing 359 ah 359 just one degree left over north but I'm standing still

788
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:14,020
zero flaps extended downwards to six in each stand 5 stand 5 5 stand 5 so that's

789
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:19,540
perfect almost a perfect stop considering the circumstances considering that I

790
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:24,000
have to be talking not while I'm abandoning both Taiwanese can Yes I can

791
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,660
So let's engage the parking brakes again, B.

792
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,300
Let's ask the tower to board the passengers.

793
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:38,340
And let's open the cabin doors for them with CTRL-R.

794
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:45,400
So that they can actually get in once they arrive, you know, once the bus brings them.

795
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:52,120
And once they bring the steps for them, so that they can climb up into the plane and so on.

796
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:56,120
Which obviously takes a while, so that's why we are not hearing anything yet.

797
01:00:56,420 --> 01:01:02,940
So while we are sitting here waiting for them, that's why I engaged my parking brakes.

798
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:05,700
For safety reasons, so that we don't move even an inch.

799
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:10,060
So that the plane doesn't move even an inch on its own.

800
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:15,420
I could ask for the runway, but the tower wouldn't give me one.

801
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:21,660
For the take-off runway, but the tower wouldn't give me one until I have passengers on board.

802
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:24,380
And we can hear them coming now, finally.

803
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:31,260
We can hear their footsteps, their boarding, and sitting down and taking off their jackets and fastening their seatbelts.

804
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:36,220
Like proper responsible passengers, that's good, because you don't even know what's coming yet.

805
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:38,620
You have no idea who you're flying with.

806
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:43,660
You have no idea that your pilot is not qualified for this type of plane.

807
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:46,300
If you did, you would never dare board it.

808
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:50,620
But since you don't, your lives are in my hands.

809
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:51,580
Your death.

810
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:52,220
Your destiny.

811
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:54,220
And your fate is all in my hands.

812
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:56,220
Just stupid.

813
01:01:56,220 --> 01:02:00,220
Okay, the last one is about to sit down.

814
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:02,220
245.

815
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:04,220
We have 245 people on board.

816
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:09,420
You can hear the sounds of other planes taxiing and taking off and landing around us.

817
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:14,220
Now we can hear the bustle and speech of the passengers.

818
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:16,220
Let's close the doors.

819
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:18,220
The outside doors, the cabin doors.

820
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:20,220
Closed.

821
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:28,060
We can also close our own cockpit with Alt-O, because this is annoyingly loud and I wanna be able to talk.

822
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:30,780
Let's disengage our parking brakes again.

823
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,060
Parking brakes off.

824
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:36,540
And now, finally, let's ask the tower to assign me the takeoff runway.

825
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:38,620
Combo runway. Asking for runway assignment.

826
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:39,420
Dashboard window.

827
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:43,900
SK696, you've been assigned runway 09 left.

828
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:44,860
You can taxi.

829
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:46,780
09 left.

830
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:48,300
You know what?

831
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:50,060
Maybe this is actually a good time.

832
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:53,820
This is a good time to show you the airport properties.

833
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:59,820
Just like the plane properties are accessible with Ctrl-Enter, the airport properties are accessible with Shift-Enter.

834
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:02,620
Combo box pilot Lucas Hosnittel, 1, collapsed.

835
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:04,620
SKFRE 696, free flight.

836
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:09,100
This reiterates the call sign of our flight and my career level.

837
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:11,660
The first official English demonstration of Eurofly 3 by Lucas.

838
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:16,620
This is the description that I filled out while creating the flight plan.

839
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:17,900
Boeing 787 Dreamliner, 3.

840
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:19,900
This is the flight, the plane type.

841
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:21,580
GLL, London, Heathrow.

842
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:29,340
This is the ICAL sign of the airport, which is actual real-world, real-life data.

843
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:34,620
This is the unique international identifier for each airport, which is obviously different for each.

844
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:36,300
Public with maintenance services, 3.

845
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:38,060
This is a category 3 airport.

846
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:44,540
It's a public one with maintenance services, so including pushback and the refuelers and stuff like that.

847
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:46,780
Height above sea level, 16m.

848
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:49,660
As we've already seen before, this is...

849
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:53,500
Located at just 16m above the sea level.

850
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:54,940
Difficulty, 1.

851
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:55,900
Difficulty, 1.

852
01:03:55,900 --> 01:04:03,100
This refers to how difficult it is to land on this airport in relation to the surrounding terrain.

853
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:12,300
So if it's a difficulty 1 airport, that means that the surrounding terrain is relatively flat and shouldn't be too challenging to land on.

854
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:13,980
Ground control, 118,5.

855
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:18,380
There are the radio frequencies for ground control and approach control.

856
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:18,780
Approach control, 113,8.

857
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:19,180
Approach control, 113,8.

858
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:19,980
And there's the airport description.

859
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:21,340
And there's the airport description.

860
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:22,460
This is the interesting part.

861
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:23,980
And the new part.

862
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:24,860
Runways 2.

863
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:25,900
There are two runways here.

864
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:28,860
Runway 09R27L, 3,657m.

865
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:34,220
There's runway 09R27L, which is...

866
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:37,100
Runway 09R27L, 3,657m.

867
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:40,540
3,657m long.

868
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:43,980
The designation...

869
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:48,540
The numbers that designate the runways are interesting.

870
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:49,100
Since it's...

871
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:58,780
Since it's a 09 runway, it means that it goes from east to west, because 90 is due east.

872
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:08,700
You should actually always add one more zero to the end of the runway designation number.

873
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:18,300
So 09 would become 090, and 27 would become 270, so due west.

874
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:19,020
So it's...

875
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:19,820
It's the same...

876
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:27,340
The very same runway in both cases, but since it's an east-west one, the 27 runway is the

877
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:29,340
other end of the runway, actually.

878
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:36,620
So if you were approaching the airport from the other side, you would likely be assigned

879
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:43,260
the runway 27L to land on, and not 09R.

880
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:45,740
L and R obviously stand for left and right.

881
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:57,420
So that's why you have different entrances, different auxiliary taxiways to help you reach

882
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:02,060
the required entrance of your assigned runway, so that you don't...

883
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:07,900
For instance, if you're supposed to be using the runway 27, you don't want to be coming...

884
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:16,700
You don't want to enter it facing east, facing 09, and to go west along the runway, actually.

885
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:18,860
So in that case, you would be doing... Going north.

886
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:22,620
Going in the exact opposite direction than what the tower assigned you.

887
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:33,260
So we see that we enter the 09R runway from the delta taxiway, and we can even hear the

888
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:37,420
latitude and longitude coordinates here.

889
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:39,660
Of that entrance point.

890
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:45,260
So it's 550 south, 150 west.

891
01:06:45,260 --> 01:07:09,680
And to get to the 27L entrance, so to the exact opposite end, we would need to be moving along Delta, then turn to the Sierra taxiway once that turning comes, then drive along Sierra, then turn to Yankee once that turning comes.

892
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:28,540
And only from the Yankee taxiway we would see the entrance to the runway 27L at coordinates 550 south, but 3380 or something east.

893
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:33,700
Yeah, the surface is asphalt of the runway.

894
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:39,540
Here's the same for the other runway, which is 09L 27L.

895
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,680
Runway 09L 27R, 3900 and 1M.

896
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,980
Which is maybe longer, if memory serves.

897
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:48,840
Runway 09R 27L, 3657M.

898
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:50,840
Yeah, it's like 300 meters longer.

899
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:52,820
Surface, runway 09L 27R.

900
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:59,380
So this airport has two runways with the exact same designations that are parallel.

901
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:05,860
They are literally next to each other as you travel along the main Delta taxiway.

902
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:09,380
First, because Delta is always the one that goes north.

903
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:10,680
South to north.

904
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:18,680
That means you would be driving along the 09R runway first, and then along 09L.

905
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:29,680
There are other taxiways like Sierra and Yankee and Foxtrot to help you get to the other end of the runway without going off the taxiway.

906
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:32,680
Entrance 09L, Delta, 850, 150.

907
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:37,680
Entrance 27R, Delta, Foxtrot, Yankee, 850, 4000, and 50.

908
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,200
You see that we would have to go north.

909
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:49,200
We would have to go from Delta to Sierra to Yankee to get to the runway 09L.

910
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:55,200
Whereas for 09R, it's Delta, then Foxtrot, then Yankee.

911
01:08:55,200 --> 01:09:03,200
Surface, ASP, runway 09L, Entrance 09L, Delta, 850, Entrance 27R, Delta, Foxtrot, Yankee, 800.

912
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:08,200
Oh, yeah, I flipped them around, but I hope you understand.

913
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,200
Hangar 1, Alpha Mike.

914
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:18,200
To get to Hangar 1, you would have to use the Alpha taxiway, then turn to Mike, and then there would be the turning to Hangar 1.

915
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:20,200
And the same is true for Hangar 2.

916
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:22,200
Main area, southeast.

917
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:37,200
The main area, which is where we'll be driving along as soon as we leave the stand, the largest chunk of the airport where all the main taxiways are leading off, that's southeast.

918
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:45,200
Meaning, you know, at the bottom right part of the airport, and the hangars are thus left of it.

919
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:55,200
If this line said that the main area was located southwest, it would mean that the hangars are located to the right of the main area.

920
01:09:55,200 --> 01:10:01,200
And thus, they would be situated in the southeast, like, corner or segment of the airport.

921
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,200
Number of gates, five.

922
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,200
It has five.

923
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,200
This airport has five gates.

924
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,200
Number of stands, five.

925
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:06,200
And also five stands.

926
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:07,200
Total area, 1,000.

927
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,200
450 x 4,150.

928
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:11,200
Yeah, this is the total area of the airport in meters.

929
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,200
Security zone 200.

930
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:20,200
There's also a security zone 200 meters wide in all directions around the airport.

931
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:32,200
So if we, like, left the runway or taxiway by accident, we would still have time to slow down or stop and turn around and get back to our designated runway.

932
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:36,200
Because there are also a new feature in version 3R.

933
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:37,200
Penalty.

934
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,200
Penalty points.

935
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:54,200
If we crash and destroy the plane or stall, obviously, that's a major accident, and we don't earn any money and any points in the global leaderboard.

936
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:58,200
But on the contrary, we even lose them, obviously, because we lost a plane.

937
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:06,200
But you can also get penalty points for minor infractions, like leaving the designated runway or starting the engines without permission.

938
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:11,200
Or entering the takeoff runway without permission, and so on.

939
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:16,200
And for, I believe, 20 accumulated penalty points, you lose a...

940
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:21,200
Or maybe for 10 accumulated penalty points, you lose a point from your earnings.

941
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:26,200
So it can actually move you down the leaderboard and decrease your overall score.

942
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:35,200
But you can check this out in detail in the rules document, which explains all these...

943
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:41,200
Details, all these principles that govern the behavior of Eurofly pilots.

944
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:53,200
And you can find these rules on the game's official website at eurofly.stafankiss.sk.

945
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:57,200
So these are the airport properties.

946
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:00,200
Have we been assigned a runway yet?

947
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,200
Oh, we are. We have.

948
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:03,200
O-line left.

949
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:04,200
That means...

950
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:09,200
That means we'll be having the farthest one...

951
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:11,200
The farthest one from...

952
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:14,200
From our current position that we can have.

953
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:25,200
Let's just fix our direction slightly.

954
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:30,200
And choke off our speed.

955
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:32,200
We're now in the main area.

956
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,200
I have to turn west.

957
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:36,200
To...

958
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:38,200
Get to the stands.

959
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:40,200
This is K696.

960
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:42,200
The passengers are already on board.

961
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,200
Oh, I don't need to.

962
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,200
I'm stupid.

963
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:51,200
0 to 257.

964
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,200
16 flaps extended downward.

965
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,200
116 main area.

966
01:12:55,200 --> 01:13:00,200
I don't need to worry about passing by the stands.

967
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,200
I have already boarded them.

968
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:03,200
307.

969
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,200
0 to 100.

970
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,200
133 flaps.

971
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:06,200
Gear 4.

972
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:07,200
Gear 0.

973
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:08,200
Let me not talk for a while.

974
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:09,200
39 flaps extended.

975
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:10,200
35 flaps extended.

976
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,200
30...

977
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,200
Gear 0.

978
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:13,200
30 flaps extended.

979
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,200
29 flaps extended downwards to 6.

980
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:17,200
21 flaps extended downwards to 6.

981
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:20,200
14 flaps extended downwards to 6.

982
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,200
Gate 3.

983
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:23,200
Let me not...

984
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:24,200
Talk over this.

985
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,200
Gate 3.

986
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,200
I need to explain the main area.

987
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:28,200
Because the main area...

988
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:29,200
Gate 3.

989
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:30,200
The main area...

990
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:31,200
Is...

991
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,200
300 meters wide.

992
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:35,200
300 meters wide from south to north.

993
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:39,200
And you can essentially split it into like 3 lanes.

994
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:51,200
The bottom most one or the south most one between the K coordinates of 0 to 100.

995
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:55,200
That's where the stands are from west to east.

996
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,200
From left to right.

997
01:13:56,200 --> 01:14:00,200
Along the length of the main area.

998
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:01,200
Gate 3.

999
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:06,200
The south to north coordinates between 100 and 200.

1000
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:07,200
229 main area.

1001
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:08,200
So we're already over this.

1002
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:09,200
Gate 3.

1003
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:15,200
Are where the main taxiways of the airport are.

1004
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:16,200
Gate 3.

1005
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,200
That's where I'm trying to get.

1006
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:25,200
Because to get to delta and then to my assigned runway 09 left, we need to go through alpha.

1007
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:26,200
Gate 3.

1008
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:27,200
Through the alpha taxiway.

1009
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,200
Gate 3.

1010
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,200
And between the south, north coordinates of 200...

1011
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:30,200
Gates 3.

1012
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:37,640
200 and 300 on the main area in the main area there are the gates so we can now hear the

1013
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:46,260
turning to gate three and let's hope i'm not going to crash into it

1014
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:53,700
turn all the way away away from it six flaps seven flaps extent seven flaps i want nothing to have

1015
01:14:53,700 --> 01:15:02,140
uh nothing to do with it seven flaps 305 let me turn all the way west 298 i think i'm going to

1016
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:10,420
make it 293 yeah i'm not going to drive into it because i 285 if i did 282 i would need to ask for

1017
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:23,020
pushback 277 275 272 268 managed not to get into it to drive into it which is good 260 247 main area

1018
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:23,600
200

1019
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:34,080
246 main area let me turn even closer to or left of west 250 closer to south 247 in order to get

1020
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:42,420
more southward on the main area 238 main area i'm now at coordinates 238 231 south to north which is

1021
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:52,420
too far up too far north 229 main area i need to get to like 0 217 223 main area below 200 220 main

1022
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:53,620
area 217

1023
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:53,680
217

1024
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:53,700
217

1025
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:56,500
217

1026
01:15:56,500 --> 01:16:06,100
seven flaps extended 210 main area 206 main area zero 203 main area 201 main area 200

1027
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:13,780
now let's turn to the right let's turn due west 213 and we'll reach the alpha taxiway 219

1028
01:16:15,940 --> 01:16:23,620
southwest because if an airplane has an alpha taxiway that's one of the three possible main

1029
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:33,860
one 240 which always uh goes due west from the main area 251 if you're not not a plane but 150 airport

1030
01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:43,380
obviously 260 if the airport has a bravo taxiway that's the same principle one of the 171 270 west

1031
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:53,460
170 main area okay this should let us enter alpha perfectly 439 main area we still have a long ways to go

1032
01:16:53,460 --> 01:17:02,260
we still have a long ways to go we just need to speed up a little bit since there

1033
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:04,500
is a bravo here

1034
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:16,340
20 flaps extended downwards to east and delta if there is one always goes due north these are the

1035
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:22,960
main three possible taxiways and 334 main area um but since there

1036
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:23,300
there are the gates to the northern main area

1037
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:24,180
278.

1038
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:33,460
Cabin lights off. Cabin lights on. 284. 200. 274. 268.

1039
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:44,260
260. 262. 263. 200. Cabin lights off. Cabin lights on. 273. 200. 279. 278.

1040
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:52,340
270. 270. 270. 270. 270. 270. 270. 200. 200. Okay. Delta.

1041
01:17:53,780 --> 01:18:02,100
Paused. Since there were the gates in the northern part of the main area, and I needed to get to

1042
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:14,100
Delta, because I know that runways 09R and 09L lead from Delta, I needed to drive a bit

1043
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:23,060
along Alpha first, so to go due west, to pass the gates on my right, to get around the gates

1044
01:18:23,860 --> 01:18:30,340
in the north, and only then, as you can see, as I was trying to align my direction, I was going

1045
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:36,420
along Alpha, there was the turning to Mike on my left, which would lead me to the hangars, but

1046
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:42,740
that's not where I wanted to go, so I kept going west, and now I'm about to turn due north to

1047
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:53,860
travel along the main taxiway of Delta. Resumed. 20 flaps extended. 294. 304. Delta.

1048
01:18:54,740 --> 01:19:02,340
Delta. I'm already on Delta, but I need to fix my direction.

1049
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:10,420
Zero. Two. Two. One. One. North. Zero. North. Now I'm going due north. 632m. 20 flaps extended

1050
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:13,940
downwards to six. At a perfect speed along Delta.

1051
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:22,100
So I think I'm pretty safe, and I'm about to stop at my designated take-off runway, which is 09L,

1052
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:26,900
and we're finally about to take off. You can see that there's a lot to do even before

1053
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:34,900
you can take off, and it's a complex process. There's the Sierra taxiway, which would help us

1054
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:40,500
to get to... Sierra 27L, if we needed to use that. Sierra.

1055
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:53,240
end of this upcoming 09R runway. Let me switch to the approach control though

1056
01:19:53,240 --> 01:20:02,260
because I know I'll be needing to talk to them now and to ask

1057
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:09,700
them for permission to enter my runway and to take off. That's now no more in

1058
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:16,060
the power of ground control so that's why. There was our 09R, we need to keep

1059
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:23,380
going further and there is a foxtrot, another taxiway, which would

1060
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:38,200
help us to get to the other end of that 09L taxiway. I'm slowing down to 10 so that I have enough time to turn to face due east then when the turning comes.

1061
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:50,940
This should give us more than enough time hopefully and I'm going to ask the

1062
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:55,780
tower to give me the permission to enter the runway. You know there might be another

1063
01:20:55,780 --> 01:21:00,520
plane there currently trying to take off from it or something so I can't just

1064
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:06,460
turn and drive into the runway without permission but I'm permitted so that's

1065
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:09,340
fine and here it comes already. So I'm turning right,

1066
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:15,840
10 degrees, 20 degrees by the way. You can change obviously the interval and the

1067
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:22,180
way it can be either sounds or words. You can configure this the way you like in the

1068
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:35,320
program settings. I'm pressing S alongside the indication to make sure.

1069
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:46,200
you have engines to zero power and hold down slash to brake. Okay we're standing

1070
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:52,180
in place extended downwards to six. Parking breaks to make sure.

1071
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:58,540
There's 3890 meters of runway left ahead of us. You can

1072
01:21:58,540 --> 01:22:09,400
find this out if you press the K key twice because K once gives you the latitude,

1073
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:16,600
coordinate or south-north coordinate but pressed twice tells you how long the runway ahead of you

1074
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:22,460
is and the same is for L which normally tells you the longitude but if you press it twice

1075
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:30,700
you'll see that there's 11 meters of the runway behind us so I before I was able to fully brake

1076
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:37,680
and fully stop I traveled only 11 meters of the runway length of the total runway length with

1077
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:45,080
which is an excellent feat if I can say so myself minimum maximum maximum minimum flat

1078
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:51,900
position minimum takeoff runway takeoff runway length is 2,700 meters and since we have 3,890

1079
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:59,820
3,890 meters left we are more than good to go because that's over a thousand meters more than

1080
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:04,820
a kilometer of runway length than we need it's always good to have

1081
01:23:04,820 --> 01:23:07,660
a research

1082
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:15,720
when trying to take off now first thing first things first let's not forget to switch to

1083
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:21,980
flight mode with shift delete flight mode or we wouldn't be able to take off at all and be

1084
01:23:21,980 --> 01:23:29,160
wondering like why am I no longer picking up any speed why am I stuck at the 10 powers 10%

1085
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:37,440
of the engines power and at the speed of like 50 now let's set the flaps upwards

1086
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:43,500
for takeoff because they're now set downwards for landing you can maximum cruising out to find out

1087
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:48,660
in the plane properties maximum cruising minimum maximum minimum flat position while taking off two

1088
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:53,700
that the minimum required flat position weight when taking off is two but I'm actually going

1089
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:59,220
to set them to six six because I already know this plane and this route very well and I know

1090
01:23:59,220 --> 01:24:07,140
that it just helps to gain the required speed faster if I said if I extend it if I extend the

1091
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:18,500
flight now let's ask for the clearance to take off combo takeoff asking for takeoff clearance

1092
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:25,120
dashboard window six nine six cleared for takeoff we are cleared for takeoff which is good let's

1093
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:29,960
press delete to find out the status of the engines just to make sure zero power zero percent gear zero

1094
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:36,540
flight mode okay so what zero position zero power zero but in gear zero but in flight mode so that's

1095
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:37,480
good R

1096
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:42,060
zero flaps extended upwards to six now tells us that we're not moving our speed is zero but

1097
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:48,540
the flaps are extended upwards to six everything's good we have takeoff clearance let's just check out

1098
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:54,180
our current takeoff speed in the plane properties briefly you can just press control enter and keep

1099
01:24:54,180 --> 01:24:59,220
pressing C condition current weight cruising speed current stall speed current takeoff speed 279

1100
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:06,900
kilometers 279 kilometers you see that we now that we've loaded fuel and uh boarded passengers

1101
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:14,700
the base takeoff speed if memory serves was 260 kilometers per hour but it's nine now 19 kilometers

1102
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:21,840
higher than that it's now 279 because we obviously got heavier so it's going to take more power and

1103
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:32,220
more runway length to for us to get moving at speed dashboard window so let's get going let's

1104
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:37,560
get in the air I'll press alt home to set the engines to gear five quickly or to the

1105
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:46,800
90 of their maximum power which is actually also the maximum recommended power to be flying safely

1106
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:54,540
oh I forgot to disengage the parking brakes you saw nothing happened B parking brakes off now alt

1107
01:25:54,540 --> 01:25:59,940
home gear six and I'll keep watching my speed with our two flaps Extended upwards to six

1108
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:06,900
five flaps Extended upwards to six I can check out my power and my engine status with delete once more

1109
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:15,520
sure. You see that the power is set to 90% and it's currently at 63. It's about to raise

1110
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:24,620
to 90. Gear 6, flight mode. So the engines are fine. We're currently cruising at the

1111
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:35,840
speed of 70. And we have still over 3,500 kilometers left ahead of us. So we're fine.

1112
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:46,220
We're more than fine. 135. So I still need to speed up by another 140 kilometers in order

1113
01:26:46,220 --> 01:26:53,540
to be able to take off successfully. 179. Now 100 more kilometers of speed and I can

1114
01:26:53,540 --> 01:27:04,640
take off. I'm going due east. So everything's fine. 226. When I have reached 279, I'm going

1115
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:05,820
to press shift down.

1116
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:11,720
I can quickly raise the nose by 10 degrees because you can press down or up. But I don't

1117
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:26,180
want to be tapping them 10 times. 5 more. My nose angle is now 150. You could hear the

1118
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:33,100
GPWS system giving us the readouts of the altitude as it increased over 100 above ground.

1119
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:35,820
And you could also hear, but it was probably drowned by the...

1120
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:45,060
The GPWS voice that the takeoff has been successful. So I can put in the landing gear

1121
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:58,140
with control G. 200. I can turn on auto navigation to the destination with alt. I was told to

1122
01:27:58,140 --> 01:28:05,300
climb to 7-1, to altitude 7-1. So alt-Y for that. 7-1-0.

1123
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:16,720
This works just like the... I need to... Oh. Shift-F. Set flaps to 2. Lower the flaps

1124
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:22,800
because my cruising speed is already high enough. And if I kept them all the way at 6, they

1125
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:27,980
would be damaged. The altitude designations work exactly the same as the runways in that

1126
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:35,000
you add one more zero to the end of the readout. So if the tower told us to climb to 7-1, that

1127
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:45,800
actually means 710 meters. 7-1-0. 383. We're above the stall speed, above the base stall

1128
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:46,800
speed.

1129
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:58,180
So I can lower the flaps or retract the flaps all the way to zero. To not be using them

1130
01:28:58,180 --> 01:29:02,840
at all. And also to avoid them getting damaged.

1131
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:03,840
440.

1132
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:11,120
see that our speed keeps getting higher now it's 453 kilometers per hour we're still turning

1133
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:16,400
to our destination this sound is the back angle indication and the

1134
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:27,120
sound played every time we turned by 10 degrees now it's stopped so you can see if i check the

1135
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:34,400
airport uh if i check my uh position uh in relation to my destination with the n

1136
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:40,800
key for navigation it says dead ahead at 328 comma seven dead ahead at 328.7

1137
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:47,600
if i check my course now 328 comma seven slash 228 comma seven auto it says auto at the end

1138
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:53,360
meaning we are flying using auto navigation and if my if i check my altitude with uh

1139
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:56,960
y 711

1140
01:29:57,120 --> 01:30:06,160
it's 711 well it's that's okay the tower asked us to climb to 710 so this is uh okay 601 the speed

1141
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:12,160
is getting ever faster the declared cruising speed of this plane is 955 kilometers per hour

1142
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:18,960
let me check the distance to the airport now 231 kilometers manchester 22 minutes that's still 231

1143
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:24,320
kilometers away and it's going to take us 22 minutes to get there at our current speed but

1144
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:27,040
since we're still gaining speed it's actually going to work

1145
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:33,600
to be much faster one more thing that i wanted to show you is another new feature in eurofly

1146
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:40,240
because as you can see already there's tons of different keystrokes and it's just not possible

1147
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:46,560
for anyone i think to remember them at all uh to remember them all uh on the first go

1148
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:51,280
you know off the top of your head so there's a help system there's an extensive interactive

1149
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:56,720
help system built into eurofly you can turn that on or off at any time with alt h

1150
01:30:57,280 --> 01:31:02,880
for help so this is actually one essential keystroke that it's really good to remember

1151
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:10,080
of age help mode on tree view there's a tree view here map 92 collapse you can see your arrow keys

1152
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:14,960
there are several different categories of keystrokes and there's a lot of them engines

1153
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:21,120
15 there's 15 keystrokes for engines and to try control category 11 on board computer 17 collapsed

1154
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:26,960
in the meantime communicator one collapsed other opening 18 bovington the map is reading out the

1155
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:32,240
playing edge easy to work with and can be addressed in a variety of ways and so it may not seem like

1156
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:36,880
the only logical thing is to turn on the application once it's put on which means you're very much

1157
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:41,520
on purpose unless you want to I put default there again in there and you can walk all the way to

1158
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:45,600
see where it goes here and here and do exactly what you're going to do what you're going to let

1159
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:48,000
it go if you want to you can turn it off once it's off and you can see well the play is down

1160
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,360
2 which is close with the networkelf switch and then killing says year 10 here's where the peak

1161
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:54,640
sounds in there and then over pret back here at the lower right here's the kickstand tip side

1162
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:54,880
1 1 a little bit faster also in there and then you can control those but i'll see that it tends to move a little

1163
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:55,440
away slightly to easier tablespoon both with concept control at the dirt�� and here's where charm as with not

1164
01:31:55,440 --> 01:32:00,780
some meaning by what it's supposed to do so let's say that I forgot how to turn

1165
01:32:00,780 --> 01:32:06,820
on and off the reverse thrust so I can just type in thrust here into the search

1166
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:15,000
field tree view map 92 search edit thrust and I if I press tab once more

1167
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,200
results combo box control plus page down reverse thrust on slash off collapsed

1168
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:22,800
there's the results there's only one keystroke and that's that says that it's

1169
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:29,280
control page down to turn the reverse thrust on or off and there's another

1170
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:33,540
edit read only less not set greater another edit field where we can just

1171
01:32:33,540 --> 01:32:39,040
press the key keystroke and it tells us what it does so if I don't know what say

1172
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:43,240
control shift enter does display all planes currently display all planes

1173
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:47,160
currently at the airport what does space do repeat the last tower announcement

1174
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:50,500
slash in a list or tree view of airports the last tower announcement or there's

1175
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:52,500
another purpose of the same keystroke when

1176
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:52,780
browsing

1177
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:57,840
the map and so on so this is what you can do sound overview combo box

1178
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:00,960
automatic operation completed collapse and there's a sound overview you can

1179
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:07,040
browse the sounds with the arrow keys and play one with space so automatic

1180
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:11,520
operation completed means if I was turning like I was before with auto

1181
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:18,360
navigation enabled or I was climbing to the set auto altitude when I hear this

1182
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:22,500
dong it means that the turning or the climb has been

1183
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:24,840
been completed course changed by specified amount of course changed by

1184
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:30,880
specified amount that's the that that place every time I turn by 10 degrees as

1185
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:35,180
configured in my program settings bank angle of the wheels winged this is this

1186
01:33:35,180 --> 01:33:40,760
place regularly when we're turning or our nose is not level take off or

1187
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:43,860
landing runway beneath the plane take off for landing runway beneath the

1188
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:48,500
plane is a really important one this is a continuous tone so you cannot

1189
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:52,300
stop it at any at any time by pressing space one more time

1190
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:59,100
this will play when we're about to land and we're flying over the or above the designated runway

1191
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:04,540
sensor warning one you are near the edge of the sensor warning so when we are near the edge of

1192
01:34:04,540 --> 01:34:12,060
the taxiway sensor warning two you this will get faster in speed as we get closer and we hear this

1193
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:17,180
continuous tone we're at the very edge of the taxiway or runway taxiway or runway entrance

1194
01:34:17,180 --> 01:34:26,620
beacon you've heard this when i was turning to delta and then to o9l etc and you can also

1195
01:34:27,260 --> 01:34:32,700
press tab one more time and there's various tips which you can browse through with the arrow keys

1196
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:37,740
telling you everything that you can do in this current mode currently we're flying so it tells

1197
01:34:37,740 --> 01:34:41,820
us anything we can do when flying perform the flight to your destination make use of the map

1198
01:34:41,820 --> 01:34:46,060
and look around you make use of the atlas in order to obtain more information control plus shift plus

1199
01:34:47,180 --> 01:34:51,260
that turns the atlas on and off communicate with other pilots control plus shift plus g

1200
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:56,380
listen to the radio or background music alt plus y etc explore the properties of the destination

1201
01:34:56,380 --> 01:35:00,460
airport control plus f8 so that's the help feature i believe that's a pretty cool one dead ahead of

1202
01:35:00,460 --> 01:35:07,260
159 kilometers we still have 159 kilometers to go to manchester so i can show you one more

1203
01:35:07,260 --> 01:35:13,100
pretty cool thing and that's the the descent map of an airport which is really useful and

1204
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:15,980
we need to check it out and we need to get familiar with that

1205
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:22,860
before we attempt to land if we want to be successful so let's uh let me pull up manchester

1206
01:35:22,860 --> 01:35:27,820
again to see its properties combo boxing control at eight england east england london england london

1207
01:35:27,820 --> 01:35:31,980
england london england england manchester england manchester now that i've found it in the list

1208
01:35:31,980 --> 01:35:40,140
let's i'll press shift enter on it to uh display its properties combo box pilot uh we saw the

1209
01:35:40,140 --> 01:35:45,980
airport description but if i now press tab combo box descent map collapsed there's the another panel

1210
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:53,100
that's the descent map height above sea level 71 f so manchester is 71 meters above sea level

1211
01:35:53,100 --> 01:35:57,740
whereas heathrow was 16 meters above sea level same altitude safe circle zero comma three k

1212
01:35:57,740 --> 01:36:07,420
same altitude safe circle 0.3 kilometers 300 meters in all directions around the airport

1213
01:36:07,420 --> 01:36:17,020
there are no hills um at the same altitude that means if i was trying to land if i was or fly

1214
01:36:17,180 --> 01:36:24,860
i was approaching the airport at an altitude of 500 and uh so there would not and i was 300 meters

1215
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:31,580
away from the airport there would be no mountains or hills or terrain changes in either direction

1216
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:36,540
but if i got farther away than 300 meters away from the airport there could be a mountain or a

1217
01:36:37,420 --> 01:36:42,460
hill on one side of the airport so that's why i have to pay attention to what the gpws is telling

1218
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:47,100
me or i have to check the i have to look ahead manually if there's an obstacle or

1219
01:36:47,180 --> 01:36:52,700
with control semicolon dashboard window if there's an obstacle in migrant altitude not detected

1220
01:36:53,260 --> 01:36:57,420
when it says not detected it means i'm flying i can keep flying on course and i'm safe there's

1221
01:36:57,420 --> 01:37:03,100
no hill or mountain in my current direction in my current altitude dead ahead 125 kilometers

1222
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:08,220
two kilometers five kilometers same altitude safe circle zero comma three and now it tells me

1223
01:37:08,220 --> 01:37:12,300
you know when i'm two kilometers away from the airport two kilometers safe altitude 142 m which

1224
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:17,100
is 43 m above ground i can climb to altitude a descent to altitude 143 meters which is

1225
01:37:17,180 --> 01:37:23,180
43 meters above ground and you'll see as we're getting farther away from the airport

1226
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:28,940
like this circle around the airport increases from two kilometers this time to five kilometers

1227
01:37:28,940 --> 01:37:35,420
five kilometers safe altitude 144 m which is the same the safe altitude uh also increases

1228
01:37:35,420 --> 01:37:41,020
so we have to climb or to descend gradually as we approach the airport 10 kilometers safe altitude

1229
01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:47,180
165 m which is 66 m above ground 15 kilometers safe altitude 177 m which is 78 m above ground to a

1230
01:37:47,180 --> 01:37:53,260
20 kilometers safe altitude 225 m which is 126 m above ground and and so on and so on all the way

1231
01:37:53,260 --> 01:37:58,700
up to 100 kilometers but if you're already flying on if you've already been assigned the runway to

1232
01:37:58,700 --> 01:38:04,780
land and you're flying on course you're aligned with the runway already you can actually descend

1233
01:38:04,780 --> 01:38:09,740
much lower and much earlier than that because now you know which side you're approaching the airport

1234
01:38:09,740 --> 01:38:15,580
from and you don't need to worry about possible like mountains on the other side of the airport

1235
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:28,380
so that's why there is a runway 5 12 27 runway 33 0 dashboard window uh wait combo i chose the

1236
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:33,820
wrong england manchester wrong airport combo combo runway zero five r ah this is manchester yeah

1237
01:38:33,820 --> 01:38:38,860
runway zero five r if we're out aligned with runway zero five r and we're approaching it

1238
01:38:38,860 --> 01:38:44,540
zero comma six km descend to 89 m which is 18 years 30 and we are 33 kilometers away from it we can

1239
01:38:44,540 --> 01:38:46,940
descend to altitude 180 meters

1240
01:38:47,180 --> 01:38:53,260
meters which is 35 kilometers descent to 108 m which is 37 37 meters above ground then when we

1241
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:59,980
are at zero comma six km 600 meters away from the airport we can descend to 89 which is 89 meters

1242
01:38:59,980 --> 01:39:08,140
which is 18 meters above ground so that's uh useful to know when we are when you're already about to

1243
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:15,740
um hit the runway to land on the runway but as i said i know this route well so i i remember these

1244
01:39:16,940 --> 01:39:17,180
values

1245
01:39:17,180 --> 01:39:21,740
values already i don't need to look them up anymore but even if i do there's a few more

1246
01:39:21,740 --> 01:39:27,420
useful keystrokes to do that with by pressing 8 on the number zero at any time i can find out

1247
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:35,500
what airport is currently the closest to me or which airport's controlled area i'm currently

1248
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:39,740
flying over controlled area east midlands 23 kilometers currently i'm in the controlled area

1249
01:39:39,740 --> 01:39:45,980
of east midlands it's 23 kilometers away from me and if i now press the comma key on the keyboard

1250
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:47,020
30 kilometers safe altitude

1251
01:39:47,180 --> 01:39:54,780
240 m which is 174 m above it tells me the current safe altitude uh circle i'm 30 kilometers away

1252
01:39:54,780 --> 01:40:00,140
from the airport or more so the self set 30 kilometers safe altitude is safe altitude 240

1253
01:40:00,140 --> 01:40:07,500
m which is 240 meters uh that's good to know i could then use the auto auto altitude to descend

1254
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:13,660
to the altitude if i wanted to i can also press period which tells me 617 above ground how high

1255
01:40:14,220 --> 01:40:17,020
above ground i currently am 617 meters

1256
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:25,820
94 and 94 semicolon is the current sea level height above sea level of the terrain 711 and 711

1257
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:33,100
z no y y sorry y is my altitude 66 kilometers manchester three minutes

1258
01:40:33,100 --> 01:40:36,860
zero comma one left at three twenty seven comma seven three twenty seven comma seven

1259
01:40:36,860 --> 01:40:41,580
slash three twenty okay let me uh ahead of time let me switch my radio frequency to

1260
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:46,780
manchester's approach control because i can remember it if i didn't i could look it up in the

1261
01:40:47,180 --> 01:40:55,900
airport properties but i know it's 135.0 set frequency 135 dashboard window so that i don't

1262
01:40:56,460 --> 01:41:01,740
i'll be alerted and the airport will greet me as soon as i get within range which is 50 kilometers

1263
01:41:01,740 --> 01:41:07,340
in this case because it's a category 3 airport you can configure this in settings as well by the way

1264
01:41:07,340 --> 01:41:16,620
but i have it set so that category 3 airports uh can be contacted when i'm 50 kilometers or less

1265
01:41:17,180 --> 01:41:24,300
far away from them 52 kilometers so the tower is going to contact us really shortly when it

1266
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:30,140
does i'm going to ask for a runway assignment and then immediately for an approach clearance

1267
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:42,300
way dash 4 sk696 you've been assigned runway zero five zero five left approach six nine six

1268
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:46,540
six you can't begin approach let's slow down you're zero let's turn off auto navigation

1269
01:41:47,180 --> 01:41:51,920
And let's set my course to 270, so due west.

1270
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:56,380
It'll take a while for me to turn by 90 degrees.

1271
01:41:56,980 --> 01:41:58,740
And I have to keep checking my speed,

1272
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:06,400
because I was approaching the airport on the course of 328 point something degrees.

1273
01:42:06,740 --> 01:42:12,120
But I was given a sign, the runway of 50, 05,

1274
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:15,020
which means I now have to fly around the airport.

1275
01:42:15,020 --> 01:42:21,680
I have to make a circle until the airport's position in relation to me is not

1276
01:42:21,680 --> 01:42:26,320
334 degrees, but due 50.

1277
01:42:26,860 --> 01:42:34,040
Once it's due 50, I can turn to face it straight, directly, head-on.

1278
01:42:34,700 --> 01:42:40,020
And that'll be the proper course that I need to be flying at

1279
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:42,660
in order to land and to reach the runway.

1280
01:42:45,020 --> 01:42:50,720
So I can already start descending a bit as well.

1281
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:59,420
The current safe altitude circle for 50 kilometers is 545 meters.

1282
01:42:59,780 --> 01:43:03,860
So let's set my auto altitude to something a little higher.

1283
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:05,980
Let's do 548, maybe.

1284
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:08,640
So I'm descending a bit.

1285
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:10,120
772.

1286
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:12,140
852.

1287
01:43:12,780 --> 01:43:14,640
548.

1288
01:43:15,020 --> 01:43:15,180
544.

1289
01:43:15,780 --> 01:43:16,760
Set altitude.

1290
01:43:16,980 --> 01:43:17,660
547.

1291
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:18,640
547.

1292
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:20,720
I don't want to be below the safe altitude.

1293
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:21,540
549.

1294
01:43:21,940 --> 01:43:24,620
549, that's a bit too high.

1295
01:43:25,140 --> 01:43:26,020
544.

1296
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:26,760
400.

1297
01:43:27,180 --> 01:43:27,560
Set altitude.

1298
01:43:28,340 --> 01:43:28,640
500.

1299
01:43:29,060 --> 01:43:29,700
548.

1300
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:30,300
Excellent.

1301
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:32,280
Let's leave it at that.

1302
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:34,020
33 kilometers, Manchester, two minutes.

1303
01:43:35,220 --> 01:43:35,900
673.

1304
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:36,740
90 right at zero.

1305
01:43:38,120 --> 01:43:43,820
The airport is now straight off to my right at position zero.

1306
01:43:44,660 --> 01:43:44,900
400.

1307
01:43:45,020 --> 01:43:49,320
Let's turn a little closer to the 300.

1308
01:43:49,820 --> 01:43:51,540
Auto course with Alt-S.

1309
01:43:53,380 --> 01:43:55,460
My speed is now still okay.

1310
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:58,340
My altitude is now okay.

1311
01:43:58,480 --> 01:43:59,240
83 right at seven.

1312
01:43:59,740 --> 01:44:00,500
33 kilometers.

1313
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:01,960
Man, the distance is still okay.

1314
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:06,260
And the airport is moving ever farther off to the right.

1315
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:14,900
I need to get it to be on course 50 before I turn to face it straight.

1316
01:44:15,220 --> 01:44:16,260
72 right at 12.

1317
01:44:18,780 --> 01:44:19,380
488 above ground.

1318
01:44:19,380 --> 01:44:21,400
I'm still 488 meters above ground.

1319
01:44:22,060 --> 01:44:22,500
548.

1320
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:29,280
At the altitude of 548 meters, so everything's going fine so far.

1321
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:32,140
76 right at 16.

1322
01:44:37,660 --> 01:44:38,100
514.

1323
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:39,500
78 right at 18.

1324
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:42,260
I need to...

1325
01:44:42,260 --> 01:44:42,960
So I need...

1326
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:44,860
Now at this point, I need to keep checking my speed.

1327
01:44:44,860 --> 01:44:45,000
I need to keep checking my speed.

1328
01:44:45,020 --> 01:44:45,820
So that I don't stall.

1329
01:44:45,980 --> 01:44:50,880
And I also need to keep checking the position of the airport in relation to my...

1330
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:51,740
81 right at 21.

1331
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:52,900
Current course.

1332
01:44:55,260 --> 01:44:55,780
482.

1333
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:01,800
The current stall speed without flaps, without any flaps, is 380.

1334
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:03,300
So I need to...

1335
01:45:03,300 --> 01:45:04,200
84 right at 24.

1336
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:06,860
Raise the flaps in time.

1337
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:07,820
84 right at 24.

1338
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:08,760
460.

1339
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:10,100
So that I don't stall.

1340
01:45:10,860 --> 01:45:13,860
But I can't raise them too early either.

1341
01:45:13,860 --> 01:45:14,860
Because if I did, I could...

1342
01:45:15,020 --> 01:45:15,520
Damage them.

1343
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:16,660
86 right at 26.

1344
01:45:16,780 --> 01:45:18,100
Because the speed would be too high.

1345
01:45:18,680 --> 01:45:19,080
445.

1346
01:45:20,620 --> 01:45:21,600
88 right at 28.

1347
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:24,300
437.

1348
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:25,340
300.

1349
01:45:25,680 --> 01:45:26,640
89 right at 29.

1350
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:27,520
500.

1351
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:29,380
I've turned to zero now.

1352
01:45:29,620 --> 01:45:29,840
Zero.

1353
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:30,920
428.

1354
01:45:35,460 --> 01:45:35,820
422.

1355
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:38,200
419.

1356
01:45:40,140 --> 01:45:40,500
416.

1357
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:41,960
71 right at 32.

1358
01:45:43,660 --> 01:45:43,980
411.

1359
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:46,260
408.

1360
01:45:46,260 --> 01:45:54,260
I think it's safe to set the flaps to position 2 for landing, which decreases the stall speed

1361
01:45:54,260 --> 01:45:58,200
from 380 kilometers per hour to 320 kilometers per hour.

1362
01:45:58,280 --> 01:45:59,800
394 flaps extended downwards to 2.

1363
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:00,580
I did it perfectly.

1364
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:04,740
So I can still keep slowing down because the current landing speed is...

1365
01:46:04,740 --> 01:46:04,940
Combo box.

1366
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:05,180
Sort of.

1367
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:05,920
Cruising speed.

1368
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:06,400
Current stall.

1369
01:46:06,540 --> 01:46:06,960
Current takeoff.

1370
01:46:07,060 --> 01:46:07,700
Current landing speed.

1371
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:08,920
278 kilometers.

1372
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:10,340
278 kilometers per hour.

1373
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:11,320
37 right at 37.

1374
01:46:11,940 --> 01:46:12,860
I also need to...

1375
01:46:12,860 --> 01:46:13,360
500.

1376
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:14,360
Keep checking the...

1377
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:15,000
380 flaps extended downwards.

1378
01:46:15,020 --> 01:46:15,460
Downwards to 2.

1379
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:17,200
The position of the...

1380
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:18,740
377 flaps extended downwards to 2.

1381
01:46:18,740 --> 01:46:19,320
Of the airport.

1382
01:46:19,460 --> 01:46:20,240
38 right at 38.

1383
01:46:20,700 --> 01:46:20,960
North.

1384
01:46:22,420 --> 01:46:23,400
I still have time.

1385
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:24,400
38 right at 38.

1386
01:46:24,680 --> 01:46:25,220
I...

1387
01:46:25,220 --> 01:46:25,680
As you...

1388
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:27,300
As I said before, I needed to be...

1389
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:28,160
39 right at 39.

1390
01:46:28,420 --> 01:46:29,980
At course 50.

1391
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:31,800
366 flaps extended downwards to 2.

1392
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:32,160
250.

1393
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:32,960
365.

1394
01:46:33,060 --> 01:46:33,700
40 right at 40.

1395
01:46:35,620 --> 01:46:36,300
Set course.

1396
01:46:36,740 --> 01:46:37,100
25.

1397
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:38,360
25 now.

1398
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:40,660
359 flaps extended downwards to 2.

1399
01:46:45,020 --> 01:46:45,900
25.

1400
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:46,720
25 right at 41.

1401
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:48,740
351 flaps extended downwards to 2.

1402
01:46:48,740 --> 01:46:52,220
359 flaps extended downwards to 2.

1403
01:46:52,220 --> 01:46:53,360
Okay.

1404
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:53,700
25.

1405
01:46:53,700 --> 01:46:54,700
25.

1406
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:55,400
17 right at 42.

1407
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:56,620
Airport is at 42.

1408
01:46:56,620 --> 01:46:57,580
17 right at 42.

1409
01:46:57,580 --> 01:46:58,420
Airport is at 42.

1410
01:46:58,420 --> 01:46:59,140
8 more degrees.

1411
01:46:59,140 --> 01:47:00,560
I needed to move by 8 more degrees.

1412
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:01,960
344 flaps extended downwards to 2.

1413
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:02,960
344.

1414
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:04,400
That's still a bit too high of a speed.

1415
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:05,280
17 right at 42.

1416
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:11,360
I need the speed to get to like 325 and then I'll extend the flaps further to position

1417
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:12,700
4 for landing.

1418
01:47:12,700 --> 01:47:13,760
336 flaps extended downwards.

1419
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:14,160
So...

1420
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:22,920
So that I'll be safe to keep slowing down to 278, 279 or what it was, the landing speed.

1421
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:24,880
The current landing speed.

1422
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:28,880
Okay, let's do flaps for landing to position 4.

1423
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:35,680
Flaps set.

1424
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:37,740
I did it, yes.

1425
01:47:38,740 --> 01:47:39,780
Without any stalling.

1426
01:47:39,780 --> 01:47:40,200
25.

1427
01:47:40,940 --> 01:47:41,860
20 right at 45.

1428
01:47:42,780 --> 01:47:43,980
21 kilometers, Manchester.

1429
01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:44,780
21 kilometers.

1430
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:54,060
I'm a little bit closer than I wanted to be, but no wonder, considering that I'm also talking to you and describing everything as I go, everything that I'm doing.

1431
01:47:54,060 --> 01:47:54,960
21 right at 46.

1432
01:47:55,220 --> 01:47:56,380
312 flaps extended downwards to 4.

1433
01:47:56,380 --> 01:47:59,280
I'm a little bit stressed out, but not too much.

1434
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:02,600
I believe I will be able to make it in time.

1435
01:48:02,680 --> 01:48:03,620
22 right at 47.

1436
01:48:04,380 --> 01:48:05,200
Three more degrees.

1437
01:48:05,340 --> 01:48:06,180
Come on, come on, come on.

1438
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:08,420
307 flaps extended downwards to 4.

1439
01:48:08,420 --> 01:48:08,620
307.

1440
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:10,540
20 more or something.

1441
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:12,080
30 more to slow down.

1442
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:13,320
23 right at 48.

1443
01:48:13,780 --> 01:48:13,940
307.

1444
01:48:13,980 --> 01:48:16,200
304 flaps extended downwards to 24 right at 49.

1445
01:48:16,700 --> 01:48:17,480
24 right at...

1446
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:18,260
24 right at...

1447
01:48:18,260 --> 01:48:18,940
24 right at...

1448
01:48:18,940 --> 01:48:19,700
24 right at...

1449
01:48:19,700 --> 01:48:20,420
302 flaps...

1450
01:48:20,420 --> 01:48:21,060
24 right at 49.

1451
01:48:21,060 --> 01:48:21,540
500.

1452
01:48:21,820 --> 01:48:22,940
24 right at 49.

1453
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:27,220
I'm going to choke the speed for now, because I need to focus on turning now.

1454
01:48:27,220 --> 01:48:28,020
25 right at 50.

1455
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:31,980
Turn right, 25 degrees.

1456
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:36,280
Zero.

1457
01:48:36,660 --> 01:48:37,480
Three right at 51.

1458
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:38,620
Oh, no.

1459
01:48:38,780 --> 01:48:40,000
I screwed it up.

1460
01:48:42,060 --> 01:48:43,100
So, let me...

1461
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:43,780
Let me...

1462
01:48:43,980 --> 01:48:44,800
500.

1463
01:48:45,260 --> 01:48:45,480
Zero.

1464
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:46,460
20.

1465
01:48:46,540 --> 01:48:46,720
30.

1466
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:47,420
Zero.

1467
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:48,760
400.

1468
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:49,600
15.

1469
01:48:50,180 --> 01:48:50,740
Zero.

1470
01:48:51,420 --> 01:48:51,780
20.

1471
01:48:52,420 --> 01:48:53,020
300.

1472
01:48:53,420 --> 01:48:53,620
50.

1473
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:54,200
0.

1474
01:48:54,540 --> 01:48:54,820
0.

1475
01:48:54,820 --> 01:48:55,360
No.

1476
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:55,700
40.

1477
01:48:55,820 --> 01:48:56,040
15.

1478
01:48:56,460 --> 01:48:56,980
200.

1479
01:48:58,660 --> 01:48:59,260
100.

1480
01:48:59,260 --> 01:48:59,700
150.

1481
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:00,020
100.

1482
01:49:00,020 --> 01:49:00,220
100.

1483
01:49:00,220 --> 01:49:00,660
100.

1484
01:49:00,660 --> 01:49:01,000
200.

1485
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:01,500
90.

1486
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:01,980
80.

1487
01:49:01,980 --> 01:49:02,560
70.

1488
01:49:02,700 --> 01:49:03,080
60.

1489
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:03,460
50.

1490
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:03,800
40.

1491
01:49:03,860 --> 01:49:04,580
Change course.

1492
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:05,760
Radio off.

1493
01:49:06,020 --> 01:49:07,000
Communicator off.

1494
01:49:07,180 --> 01:49:07,760
Atlas off.

1495
01:49:08,860 --> 01:49:10,320
And I was turning too sharply.

1496
01:49:10,820 --> 01:49:11,360
I panicked.

1497
01:49:12,020 --> 01:49:13,260
You can't just...

1498
01:49:13,980 --> 01:49:15,960
Turn the wheels.

1499
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:20,140
You can't just turn the wheels or wings.

1500
01:49:20,140 --> 01:49:20,440
Flight evaluation dialogue.

1501
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:21,080
Edit flight.

1502
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:31,140
I mean, on the ground, you can bank the wheels by up to 50 degrees to either left or right.

1503
01:49:31,580 --> 01:49:32,140
Obviously.

1504
01:49:34,660 --> 01:49:41,300
But while flying, you can only bank the wings by up to 25 degrees.

1505
01:49:41,300 --> 01:49:43,740
If you do more, if you panic like I just did...

1506
01:49:43,740 --> 01:49:44,500
You can do more.

1507
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:47,700
You can set the bank angle of the wings to like 50.

1508
01:49:47,820 --> 01:49:51,120
But if you do, that's just too steep of a bank angle.

1509
01:49:51,140 --> 01:49:53,400
You will not be able to recover from that anymore.

1510
01:49:53,400 --> 01:50:00,060
And it's just an unrecoverable stall all the way to the ground, like what just happened.

1511
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:01,740
So flight evaluation.

1512
01:50:02,340 --> 01:50:02,780
You can...

1513
01:50:02,780 --> 01:50:05,160
We can read the flight evaluation.

1514
01:50:05,160 --> 01:50:07,060
Flight length 272 kilometers.

1515
01:50:07,320 --> 01:50:08,880
Flight duration 33 minutes.

1516
01:50:09,480 --> 01:50:10,480
Points minus 10.

1517
01:50:11,060 --> 01:50:13,480
It's a real shame because we were almost...

1518
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:15,040
Almost about to land successfully.

1519
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:18,040
Earnings minus 20, minor crashes zero, penalty points one.

1520
01:50:18,820 --> 01:50:19,900
Started engines without permission.

1521
01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:22,300
Cause of fatal stall, bank angle too steep.

1522
01:50:22,580 --> 01:50:25,240
Cause of fatal stall, bank angle too steep, blank, blank.

1523
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:27,220
Dashboard window.

1524
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:28,900
Press enter to quit.

1525
01:50:28,980 --> 01:50:29,920
Free flights.

1526
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:32,200
But you know what?

1527
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:38,200
I know I said I wouldn't be editing anything out, which I won't, but I've changed my mind.

1528
01:50:38,240 --> 01:50:41,680
I can't just let end this here like that.

1529
01:50:42,940 --> 01:50:43,480
I can't.

1530
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:48,820
And I can't allow myself to end the recording with a crash, with a stall.

1531
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:57,640
So what I'm about to do, I'm going to take exactly, literally the same flight with the same plane from the same airport to the same airport.

1532
01:50:58,720 --> 01:51:02,320
I'm going to pause the recording here and I'm going to resume it again.

1533
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:12,940
Um, when I'm turning and descending to align myself with the landing runway, obviously I'll be having a different call sign this time.

1534
01:51:12,940 --> 01:51:20,440
But I will do it again this time and I will do it proper because I can't, I don't want to let you down.

1535
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:29,020
And I don't want to, I don't want to let myself down while I've already let the 217 or how many passengers I had down who are dead now.

1536
01:51:29,860 --> 01:51:33,880
But I believe that everyone deserves a second chance, including myself.

1537
01:51:34,660 --> 01:51:42,640
So in order to finish this recording in a, on a happy note and a successful note, um, I'll be right back with you.

1538
01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:50,360
When I'm in the air again and I'm about to, um, face the, the airport, the landing runway.

1539
01:51:51,500 --> 01:51:52,640
All right, I'm back.

1540
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:58,300
I'm 27 kilometers away from Manchester, a little bit farther away than before.

1541
01:51:58,300 --> 01:51:59,420
330 flaps extended.

1542
01:51:59,660 --> 01:52:07,320
330, let me do flaps for landing to position four because style speed is 320 at the moment.

1543
01:52:08,380 --> 01:52:10,300
And current landing speed is...

1544
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:12,600
Current landing speed, 275.

1545
01:52:12,640 --> 01:52:20,080
275, and let me focus on piloting, only on piloting for now a little bit so that I don't crash again.

1546
01:52:20,980 --> 01:52:24,200
I've explained the principle anyway, and I'll explain the rest as I go.

1547
01:52:24,200 --> 01:52:25,800
316 flaps extended downwards to four.

1548
01:52:27,320 --> 01:52:30,480
We should be fine to go now.

1549
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:33,100
30 kilometers safe altitude 545M, which is 474M above ground.

1550
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:35,320
As long as I don't, don't screw up anything.

1551
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:37,640
311 flaps extended downwards to four.

1552
01:52:37,900 --> 01:52:38,800
18 right at 43.

1553
01:52:39,640 --> 01:52:40,540
Okay.

1554
01:52:40,580 --> 01:52:41,500
18 right at 43.

1555
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:42,540
25.

1556
01:52:43,640 --> 01:52:50,780
So I can't turn, I can't start turning too sharply like I did before, or I'm going to stall.

1557
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:53,720
303 flaps extended downwards to four.

1558
01:52:54,380 --> 01:52:56,100
275, yeah, is landing speed.

1559
01:52:56,260 --> 01:52:56,460
Okay.

1560
01:52:57,500 --> 01:52:58,560
19 right at 44.

1561
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:00,600
25.

1562
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:02,920
22 kilometers Manchester, four minutes.

1563
01:53:03,480 --> 01:53:04,960
299 flaps extended downwards to four.

1564
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:06,340
Still closer than I would like to be.

1565
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:07,160
20 right at 45.

1566
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:08,200
But never mind.

1567
01:53:08,620 --> 01:53:09,180
25.

1568
01:53:11,800 --> 01:53:12,620
295 flaps extended downwards to four.

1569
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:15,640
20 more kilometers to slow down.

1570
01:53:15,700 --> 01:53:16,740
21 right at 46.

1571
01:53:18,140 --> 01:53:19,840
293 flaps extended downwards to four.

1572
01:53:20,020 --> 01:53:24,280
This is really difficult to concentrate and to talk at the same time, and I have to concentrate here.

1573
01:53:24,280 --> 01:53:25,220
22 right at 47.

1574
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:27,540
290 flaps extended downwards to four.

1575
01:53:27,640 --> 01:53:28,640
I don't want to screw up.

1576
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:30,100
22 right at 47.

1577
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:33,340
288 flaps extended downwards to four.

1578
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:35,480
22 right at 47.

1579
01:53:37,140 --> 01:53:38,660
286 flaps extended downwards to four.

1580
01:53:38,740 --> 01:53:39,640
23 right at 48.

1581
01:53:39,640 --> 01:53:41,040
If I have at least 280.

1582
01:53:41,220 --> 01:53:42,620
284 flaps extended downwards to four.

1583
01:53:42,620 --> 01:53:49,900
I can choke the engines and keep it going.

1584
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:50,940
281 flaps extended.

1585
01:53:51,060 --> 01:53:51,720
281 flaps.

1586
01:53:51,820 --> 01:53:52,800
24 right at 49.

1587
01:53:53,060 --> 01:53:53,740
280 flaps extended downwards to four.

1588
01:53:53,740 --> 01:53:54,060
500.

1589
01:53:54,440 --> 01:53:54,780
Choked off.

1590
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:55,940
24 right at 49.

1591
01:53:56,140 --> 01:53:56,540
Excellent.

1592
01:53:56,960 --> 01:53:57,860
25 right at 50.

1593
01:53:59,860 --> 01:54:00,100
Now.

1594
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:00,840
31.

1595
01:54:02,300 --> 01:54:02,540
30.

1596
01:54:02,660 --> 01:54:03,000
37.

1597
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:03,380
38.

1598
01:54:03,500 --> 01:54:03,860
40.

1599
01:54:04,060 --> 01:54:04,800
Course 40.

1600
01:54:04,860 --> 01:54:05,160
43.

1601
01:54:06,820 --> 01:54:07,260
Zero.

1602
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:07,900
Dead ahead at 50.

1603
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:09,520
Yes, dead ahead at 50.

1604
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:10,680
Dead ahead at 50.

1605
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:11,960
279 flaps extended downwards to four.

1606
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:12,480
279.

1607
01:54:12,620 --> 01:54:14,120
279 is my current speed, which is OK.

1608
01:54:14,220 --> 01:54:16,340
I can land at 279 kilometers per hour.

1609
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:17,120
Dead ahead at 50.

1610
01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:17,900
Dead ahead at 50.

1611
01:54:17,900 --> 01:54:19,580
16 kilometers, though.

1612
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:34,800
I know I can already descend to 108 meters altitude when I'm aligned with the runway because I remember it.

1613
01:54:34,860 --> 01:54:37,300
But if I didn't, I could look it up in the airport properties.

1614
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:39,240
Let's set the flaps.

1615
01:54:39,240 --> 01:54:39,720
400.

1616
01:54:39,720 --> 01:54:42,600
For landing all the way up to six.

1617
01:54:42,620 --> 01:54:45,280
So that I can brake as fast as I can.

1618
01:54:45,460 --> 01:54:48,920
Let's lower the landing gear with Control-G.

1619
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:51,960
300.

1620
01:54:52,260 --> 01:54:53,920
I'm still descending in the meantime.

1621
01:54:55,740 --> 01:54:56,180
Climb.

1622
01:54:56,440 --> 01:54:57,320
Collision with the ground.

1623
01:54:57,360 --> 01:54:57,940
13 kilometers.

1624
01:54:58,060 --> 01:54:58,320
Manchester.

1625
01:54:58,420 --> 01:54:58,700
Two minutes.

1626
01:54:59,040 --> 01:54:59,600
13 kilometers.

1627
01:54:59,740 --> 01:54:59,940
Manchester.

1628
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:00,380
Two minutes.

1629
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:09,000
Yeah, GPWS is warning me of an imminent collision with the ground, but I know it's an OK altitude.

1630
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:12,460
I'll still be like 70 meters above the ground.

1631
01:55:12,620 --> 01:55:13,620
130.

1632
01:55:13,620 --> 01:55:14,620
120.

1633
01:55:14,620 --> 01:55:17,620
And it's safe to be this low when aligned with the runway.

1634
01:55:17,620 --> 01:55:18,120
Climb.

1635
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:18,620
90.

1636
01:55:18,620 --> 01:55:19,120
Imminent.

1637
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:19,620
80.

1638
01:55:20,620 --> 01:55:21,620
71 above ground.

1639
01:55:21,620 --> 01:55:22,620
71 above ground.

1640
01:55:22,620 --> 01:55:23,620
Yeah.

1641
01:55:23,620 --> 01:55:24,620
One right at 51.

1642
01:55:24,620 --> 01:55:25,620
Climb.

1643
01:55:25,620 --> 01:55:26,620
Collision with the ground.

1644
01:55:26,620 --> 01:55:27,620
Imminent.

1645
01:55:27,620 --> 01:55:28,620
One right at 51.

1646
01:55:28,620 --> 01:55:29,620
11 kilometers.

1647
01:55:29,620 --> 01:55:30,620
Manchester.

1648
01:55:30,620 --> 01:55:31,620
Two minutes.

1649
01:55:31,620 --> 01:55:32,620
Climb.

1650
01:55:32,620 --> 01:55:33,620
Collision with the ground.

1651
01:55:33,620 --> 01:55:34,620
Imminent.

1652
01:55:34,620 --> 01:55:35,620
Zip.

1653
01:55:35,620 --> 01:55:36,620
Zip.

1654
01:55:36,620 --> 01:55:37,620
One right at 51.

1655
01:55:37,620 --> 01:55:38,620
50.

1656
01:55:38,620 --> 01:55:39,620
Climb.

1657
01:55:39,620 --> 01:55:40,620
Collision with the ground.

1658
01:55:40,620 --> 01:55:41,620
Imminent.

1659
01:55:41,620 --> 01:55:42,620
51 above ground.

1660
01:55:42,620 --> 01:55:43,620
That's all good.

1661
01:55:43,620 --> 01:55:44,620
When I'm 5 kilometers away from the airport, I can press control S to invoke the ILS system.

1662
01:55:44,620 --> 01:55:45,620
Which runway do I have?

1663
01:55:45,620 --> 01:55:46,620
Climb.

1664
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:47,620
Collision with the ground.

1665
01:55:47,620 --> 01:55:48,620
Imminent.

1666
01:55:48,620 --> 01:55:49,620
Oh no.

1667
01:55:49,620 --> 01:55:50,620
Dashboard window.

1668
01:55:50,620 --> 01:55:51,620
Oh.

1669
01:55:51,620 --> 01:55:52,620
Runway.

1670
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:53,620
05 right.

1671
01:55:53,620 --> 01:55:54,620
Climb.

1672
01:55:54,620 --> 01:55:55,620
Collision with the ground.

1673
01:55:55,620 --> 01:55:56,620
Imminent.

1674
01:55:56,620 --> 01:55:57,620
ILS will offer.

1675
01:55:57,620 --> 01:55:58,620
You know what?

1676
01:55:58,620 --> 01:55:59,620
GPWS off.

1677
01:55:59,620 --> 01:56:00,620
ILS.

1678
01:56:00,620 --> 01:56:01,620
ILS will offer.

1679
01:56:01,620 --> 01:56:02,620
GPWS off.

1680
01:56:02,620 --> 01:56:03,620
GPWS off.

1681
01:56:03,620 --> 01:56:04,620
GPWS off.

1682
01:56:04,620 --> 01:56:05,620
GPWS off.

1683
01:56:05,620 --> 01:56:06,620
GPWS off.

1684
01:56:06,620 --> 01:56:07,620
GPWS off.

1685
01:56:07,620 --> 01:56:08,620
GPWS off.

1686
01:56:08,620 --> 01:56:09,620
GPWS off.

1687
01:56:09,620 --> 01:56:10,620
GPWS off.

1688
01:56:10,620 --> 01:56:15,620
ILS will offer the runways that are available.

1689
01:56:15,620 --> 01:56:22,620
Meaning 05L or 05R.

1690
01:56:22,620 --> 01:56:30,620
And when I choose one, so 05 right, the runway will start sending out a radio beacon of some

1691
01:56:30,620 --> 01:56:38,620
kind, which then auto guides my plane in order to stay on course, stay aligned with the runway.

1692
01:56:38,620 --> 01:56:39,620
But it can only be done.

1693
01:56:39,620 --> 01:56:40,620
Only be done.

1694
01:56:40,620 --> 01:56:41,620
05L collapse.

1695
01:56:41,620 --> 01:56:42,620
05R.

1696
01:56:42,620 --> 01:56:43,620
Dashboard window.

1697
01:56:43,620 --> 01:56:44,620
Yes.

1698
01:56:44,620 --> 01:56:45,620
Only be done when I'm close enough to the airport.

1699
01:56:45,620 --> 01:56:46,620
1 right at 51.

1700
01:56:46,620 --> 01:56:48,620
Now you can, if I check my course, you can hear.

1701
01:56:48,620 --> 01:56:49,620
51,2 ILS.

1702
01:56:49,620 --> 01:56:55,620
That I'm 51.2 on course 51.2, but it says ILS, meaning I'm being guided.

1703
01:56:55,620 --> 01:56:57,620
1 right at 51.

1704
01:56:57,620 --> 01:56:58,620
3,6KM Manchester.

1705
01:56:58,620 --> 01:56:59,620
To the airport.

1706
01:56:59,620 --> 01:57:00,620
Okay.

1707
01:57:00,620 --> 01:57:01,620
I should be.

1708
01:57:01,620 --> 01:57:02,620
279 flaps extended downwards to 6.

1709
01:57:02,620 --> 01:57:03,620
I should actually be okay.

1710
01:57:03,620 --> 01:57:04,620
Last system.

1711
01:57:04,620 --> 01:57:05,620
Length.

1712
01:57:05,620 --> 01:57:06,620
Landing gear lowered.

1713
01:57:06,620 --> 01:57:07,620
Dashboard.

1714
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:08,620
Gear lowered.

1715
01:57:08,620 --> 01:57:09,620
Altitude is.

1716
01:57:09,620 --> 01:57:10,620
279 flaps extended downwards to 6.

1717
01:57:10,620 --> 01:57:11,620
Speed is okay.

1718
01:57:11,620 --> 01:57:12,620
Flaps are okay.

1719
01:57:12,620 --> 01:57:13,620
Direction is okay.

1720
01:57:13,620 --> 01:57:14,620
1 right at 51.

1721
01:57:14,620 --> 01:57:15,620
Since I'm.

1722
01:57:15,620 --> 01:57:16,620
51,1 ILS.

1723
01:57:16,620 --> 01:57:17,620
On ILS.

1724
01:57:17,620 --> 01:57:18,620
14.

1725
01:57:18,620 --> 01:57:19,620
Alright.

1726
01:57:19,620 --> 01:57:20,620
1,9KM Manchester.

1727
01:57:20,620 --> 01:57:21,620
0 minutes.

1728
01:57:21,620 --> 01:57:27,620
In Eurofly 3 you can't just, you know, land anywhere near the airport and just lower

1729
01:57:27,620 --> 01:57:28,620
the nose.

1730
01:57:28,620 --> 01:57:30,620
You have to be aligned with the runway like I just did.

1731
01:57:30,620 --> 01:57:35,620
You have to be no more than 20 meters above the ground, otherwise you would stall and

1732
01:57:35,620 --> 01:57:36,620
break the plane.

1733
01:57:36,620 --> 01:57:37,620
0,5KM.

1734
01:57:37,620 --> 01:57:38,620
If you are.

1735
01:57:38,620 --> 01:57:39,620
Let me.

1736
01:57:39,620 --> 01:57:40,620
Get.

1737
01:57:40,620 --> 01:57:41,620
Get.

1738
01:57:41,620 --> 01:57:42,620
20 meters above the ground only.

1739
01:57:42,620 --> 01:57:43,620
30.

1740
01:57:43,620 --> 01:57:44,620
8.

1741
01:57:44,620 --> 01:57:45,620
29.

1742
01:57:45,620 --> 01:57:46,620
28.

1743
01:57:46,620 --> 01:57:47,620
27.

1744
01:57:47,620 --> 01:57:48,620
26.

1745
01:57:48,620 --> 01:57:49,620
25.

1746
01:57:49,620 --> 01:57:50,620
24.

1747
01:57:50,620 --> 01:57:51,620
24.

1748
01:57:51,620 --> 01:57:52,620
23.

1749
01:57:52,620 --> 01:57:53,620
22.

1750
01:57:53,620 --> 01:57:54,620
22.

1751
01:57:54,620 --> 01:57:55,620
Runway 0.

1752
01:57:55,620 --> 01:57:56,620
20.

1753
01:57:56,620 --> 01:57:57,620
And land.

1754
01:57:57,620 --> 01:57:58,620
When you're 20 above ground, you lower.

1755
01:57:58,620 --> 01:57:59,620
You.

1756
01:57:59,620 --> 01:58:00,620
10.

1757
01:58:00,620 --> 01:58:01,620
Level the nose.

1758
01:58:01,620 --> 01:58:02,620
Level the nose and set the engines all the way down to 0 and essentially let the plane

1759
01:58:02,620 --> 01:58:03,620
fall.

1760
01:58:03,620 --> 01:58:04,620
Taxi mode.

1761
01:58:04,620 --> 01:58:05,620
85 flaps extended.

1762
01:58:05,620 --> 01:58:06,620
82 flaps.

1763
01:58:06,620 --> 01:58:07,620
79 flaps extended.

1764
01:58:07,620 --> 01:58:08,620
Moving slash.

1765
01:58:08,620 --> 01:58:09,620
64 flaps.

1766
01:58:09,620 --> 01:58:10,620
All the way to 50.

1767
01:58:10,620 --> 01:58:11,620
58.

1768
01:58:11,620 --> 01:58:12,620
Kilometers per hour.

1769
01:58:12,620 --> 01:58:13,620
55.

1770
01:58:13,620 --> 01:58:14,620
Flaps.

1771
01:58:14,620 --> 01:58:15,620
54.

1772
01:58:15,620 --> 01:58:16,620
53.

1773
01:58:16,620 --> 01:58:17,620
52.

1774
01:58:17,620 --> 01:58:18,620
51.

1775
01:58:18,620 --> 01:58:19,620
Flaps.

1776
01:58:19,620 --> 01:58:20,620
51.

1777
01:58:20,620 --> 01:58:21,620
Flaps.

1778
01:58:21,620 --> 01:58:22,620
50.

1779
01:58:22,620 --> 01:58:23,620
Flaps.

1780
01:58:23,620 --> 01:58:24,620
Extended.

1781
01:58:24,620 --> 01:58:25,620
Choke off.

1782
01:58:25,620 --> 01:58:26,620
Choke off.

1783
01:58:26,620 --> 01:58:27,620
49 flaps extended downwards to 6.

1784
01:58:27,620 --> 01:58:28,620
19.

1785
01:58:28,620 --> 01:58:29,620
65m.

1786
01:58:29,620 --> 01:58:30,620
19.

1787
01:58:30,620 --> 01:58:31,620
44m.

1788
01:58:31,620 --> 01:58:32,620
We have 19.

1789
01:58:32,620 --> 01:58:33,620
44 meters left.

1790
01:58:33,620 --> 01:58:34,620
50,0 ILS.

1791
01:58:34,620 --> 01:58:35,620
Of the runway ahead of us, which is perfect.

1792
01:58:35,620 --> 01:58:36,620
We're on course because ILS is guiding us.

1793
01:58:36,620 --> 01:58:37,620
49 flaps extended downwards to 6.

1794
01:58:37,620 --> 01:58:38,620
And it's excellent because we did it without having to stop all the way.

1795
01:58:38,620 --> 01:58:39,620
As it should be.

1796
01:58:39,620 --> 01:58:40,620
If you've ever flown on a plane in real life, you'll have noticed that the plane did not

1797
01:58:40,620 --> 01:58:41,620
just stop, you know, after landing, brake all the way to a full stop, and then pick

1798
01:58:41,620 --> 01:58:42,620
up less speed again.

1799
01:58:42,620 --> 01:58:43,620
1.

1800
01:58:43,620 --> 01:58:44,620
Power.

1801
01:58:44,620 --> 01:58:45,620
0,0%.

1802
01:58:45,620 --> 01:58:46,620
Gear 1.

1803
01:58:46,620 --> 01:58:47,620
Taxi mode.

1804
01:58:47,620 --> 01:58:48,620
Yeah, we're in taxi mode.

1805
01:58:48,620 --> 01:58:49,620
49 flaps extended downwards to 6.

1806
01:58:49,620 --> 01:58:50,620
Flaps for landing.

1807
01:58:50,620 --> 01:58:51,620
Oh, and I forgot.

1808
01:58:51,620 --> 01:58:52,620
Oh, and I forgot.

1809
01:58:52,620 --> 01:58:53,620
Oh, and I forgot.

1810
01:58:53,620 --> 01:58:54,620
Oh, and I forgot.

1811
01:58:54,620 --> 01:58:55,620
Oh, and I forgot.

1812
01:58:55,620 --> 01:58:56,620
Oh, and I forgot.

1813
01:58:56,620 --> 01:58:57,620
Oh, and I forgot.

1814
01:58:57,620 --> 01:58:58,620
Oh, and I forgot.

1815
01:58:58,620 --> 01:58:59,620
Oh, and I forgot.

1816
01:58:59,620 --> 01:59:00,620
Oh, and I forgot.

1817
01:59:00,620 --> 01:59:09,620
I believe I forgot to ask for the clearance to land.

1818
01:59:09,620 --> 01:59:10,920
Taxi lights off.

1819
01:59:10,920 --> 01:59:11,920
Landing lights on.

1820
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:12,920
Landing lights on.

1821
01:59:12,920 --> 01:59:13,920
Yeah.

1822
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:19,540
I forgot about the taxi and landing lights, to turn off taxi lights after takeoff, to

1823
01:59:19,540 --> 01:59:24,860
turn on landing lights before landing, and I forgot to ask for the clearance to land,

1824
01:59:24,860 --> 01:59:28,220
which is pretty bad.

1825
01:59:28,220 --> 01:59:30,600
But it shouldn't be happening.

1826
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:36,960
cost. We essentially landed without clearance, so I believe, I'm almost sure, I'm going to get

1827
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:42,760
penalized with penalty points for that. We'll see it in the end, in the flight evaluation,

1828
01:59:43,400 --> 01:59:52,720
but never mind. Things like that happen. Let's switch our frequency to Manchester Ground Control

1829
01:59:52,720 --> 02:00:06,000
118.6. Let's slow down and let's ask them to assign us a gate. We're supposed to taxi to

1830
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:15,540
stand 1 to onboard our passengers. All right. Let's slow down to 20 now, 20 kilometers per hour

1831
02:00:15,540 --> 02:00:21,840
to make our movement faster, if we went, safer, to make our movement safer, because if we were

1832
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:22,700
going faster, then we would have to go faster. So, let's slow down and let's ask them to assign

1833
02:00:22,720 --> 02:00:35,440
that. We may not be able to turn by 90 degrees on time. We still have 368 meters of runway

1834
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:44,500
ahead of us to go. We're supposed to go to stand 1, was it? Yes. The next runway ahead of us,

1835
02:00:44,540 --> 02:00:49,160
because I know this airport, I know it's going to be Yankee and it's going to be facing due east.

1836
02:00:49,600 --> 02:00:52,600
The turning is going to be due east. We're currently on course,

1837
02:00:52,720 --> 02:00:59,500
50, but Yankee is a north-south taxiway. So, I'm going to need to turn to get to the runway

1838
02:00:59,500 --> 02:01:06,420
to turn due east. And then when I do, when I am on the runway, I need to turn by 90 more degrees

1839
02:01:06,420 --> 02:01:16,740
to the right to be facing due south. That'll lead me to the Sierra taxiway. Then I'll need

1840
02:01:16,740 --> 02:01:22,160
to traverse that. That'll lead me to Delta. Then I'll need to turn again and traverse Delta.

1841
02:01:22,720 --> 02:01:29,240
All the way to Mike and to Zulu. And Zulu will finally lead me to the stands. Here we go.

1842
02:01:30,500 --> 02:01:43,260
The Yankee taxiway on our right at course 90, 0, 0, 95. Oh, 94, 93, 92, 91 east. And now turn all the way to go south.

1843
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:51,540
119. 20 flaps extended downwards to 142.

1844
02:01:52,720 --> 02:02:06,480
152. 160. 169. 0. 182. 181. 181. South. 0. 100. 100. 100. South. 0. South. 1924m.

1845
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:12,420
1924 meters, so we can speed up all the way to 50 kilometers per hour again to traverse

1846
02:02:12,420 --> 02:02:18,820
the Yankee faster. We're now going due south. You can check the angle, the back angle of

1847
02:02:18,820 --> 02:02:20,500
your nose at any time with T.

1848
02:02:20,500 --> 02:02:22,500
34 flaps. 35 flaps. 36 flaps extended downwards to 6.

1849
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:30,400
Of your wheels while on the ground or wings while airborne with T at any, with G at any

1850
02:02:30,400 --> 02:02:31,400
time.

1851
02:02:31,400 --> 02:02:33,400
47 flaps. 48. 49. 49. 50 flaps extended downwards to 6.

1852
02:02:33,400 --> 02:02:39,500
And if you press T twice rapidly in short succession, you level the nose. And if you

1853
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:44,700
press G twice rapidly, you level the wings or wheels. So that's how it works.

1854
02:02:44,700 --> 02:02:46,700
1500 in 9F.

1855
02:02:46,700 --> 02:02:50,000
Still 1.5 kilometers left.

1856
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:51,000
0.5.

1857
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:52,000
0.5.

1858
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
And let's check our coordinates.

1859
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:55,000
1854 Yankee.

1860
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:56,860
We're still all the way up north.

1861
02:02:56,860 --> 02:02:58,380
2550 Yankee.

1862
02:02:58,380 --> 02:03:01,960
And even more farther to the right to the east.

1863
02:03:01,960 --> 02:03:05,920
Uh, because the coordinates, they tell you the name of the taxiway, or the runway that

1864
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:11,620
you're currently moving on, but the coordinate system, the numbering, the entire numbering

1865
02:03:11,620 --> 02:03:16,320
refers to the whole overall, uh, area, and size of the airport.

1866
02:03:16,320 --> 02:03:19,520
15. 50 flaps extended downwards to 6.

1867
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:21,560
1062m.

1868
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:37,320
You can see that our south-north coordinate is decreasing, so we're going south, and we

1869
02:03:37,320 --> 02:03:44,940
can see in the coordinates that we're actually getting closer and closer to the south part,

1870
02:03:44,940 --> 02:03:45,940
south edge of the airport.

1871
02:03:45,940 --> 02:03:56,620
Oh my god, let me slow down.

1872
02:03:56,620 --> 02:04:03,000
Because our turning to Sierra is coming, I believe that'll be on our right, we'll be

1873
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:04,000
going west.

1874
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:11,000
It's still okay, I'm panicking needlessly.

1875
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:15,920
Oh, I don't want to crash or leave the runway.

1876
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:25,940
Because I didn't turn in time, because that would also earn me more penalty points, but

1877
02:04:25,940 --> 02:04:32,760
other than that, we're pretty safe now, now that we're just on the ground and only taxiing

1878
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:37,900
along the airport.

1879
02:04:37,900 --> 02:04:44,480
Still 291 meters of Yankee to go.

1880
02:04:44,480 --> 02:04:45,480
Pretty fine.

1881
02:04:45,480 --> 02:04:46,480
We're going south.

1882
02:04:46,480 --> 02:04:47,480
Okay, everything's fine.

1883
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:55,080
I'm just triple and quadruple checking everything at this point, because I really don't want

1884
02:04:55,080 --> 02:04:58,900
to have to redo this whole thing all over again.

1885
02:04:58,900 --> 02:05:00,360
But I think we're fine.

1886
02:05:00,360 --> 02:05:12,680
I'm way more nervous than my passengers are, I hope, and that's exactly how it should be.

1887
02:05:12,680 --> 02:05:14,500
So you see, this airport has a different layout.

1888
02:05:15,480 --> 02:05:33,760
It has the runways 05, 0523, 0523 is a one, 0523L or 0523R, and the, they're not beginning

1889
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:37,280
straight at Delta.

1890
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:41,480
We have to go through these Sierra and Yankee taxiways in order to get to the runways.

1891
02:05:41,480 --> 02:05:43,480
Oh, so that's why you need to...

1892
02:05:43,480 --> 02:05:44,480
249.

1893
02:05:44,480 --> 02:05:45,480
249.

1894
02:05:45,480 --> 02:05:46,480
Sierra.

1895
02:05:46,480 --> 02:05:47,480
257.

1896
02:05:47,480 --> 02:05:48,480
262.

1897
02:05:48,480 --> 02:05:49,480
Sierra.

1898
02:05:49,480 --> 02:05:50,480
Learn the...

1899
02:05:50,480 --> 02:05:51,480
273.

1900
02:05:51,480 --> 02:05:52,480
274.

1901
02:05:52,480 --> 02:05:53,480
275.

1902
02:05:53,480 --> 02:05:54,480
276.

1903
02:05:54,480 --> 02:05:55,480
0.

1904
02:05:55,480 --> 02:05:56,480
0.

1905
02:05:56,480 --> 02:05:57,480
0.

1906
02:05:57,480 --> 02:05:58,480
390.

1907
02:05:58,480 --> 02:05:59,480
Sierra.

1908
02:05:59,480 --> 02:06:00,480
Uh, yeah.

1909
02:06:00,480 --> 02:06:01,480
276.

1910
02:06:01,480 --> 02:06:02,480
200.

1911
02:06:02,480 --> 02:06:03,480
2002.

1912
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:04,480
0.

1913
02:06:04,480 --> 02:06:05,480
274.

1914
02:06:05,480 --> 02:06:06,480
273.

1915
02:06:06,480 --> 02:06:07,480
272.

1916
02:06:07,480 --> 02:06:08,480
272.

1917
02:06:08,480 --> 02:06:09,480
271.

1918
02:06:09,480 --> 02:06:10,480
West.

1919
02:06:10,480 --> 02:06:11,480
216.

1920
02:06:11,480 --> 02:06:12,480
200.

1921
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:13,480
200.

1922
02:06:13,480 --> 02:06:14,480
200.

1923
02:06:14,480 --> 02:06:15,480
West.

1924
02:06:15,480 --> 02:06:16,480
200.

1925
02:06:16,480 --> 02:06:17,480
200.

1926
02:06:17,480 --> 02:06:18,480
200.

1927
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:19,480
2...

1928
02:06:19,480 --> 02:06:23,480
The layout of each airport, uh, individually.

1929
02:06:23,480 --> 02:06:28,480
Preferably before landing on it, or before taking off from it, while you still have time,

1930
02:06:28,480 --> 02:06:33,480
uh, by looking at its properties as I was describing before.

1931
02:06:33,480 --> 02:06:39,480
Now, uh, two, two kilometers of Sierra ahead.

1932
02:06:39,480 --> 02:06:42,480
We're going 22 West.

1933
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:43,480
Okay.

1934
02:06:43,480 --> 02:06:44,480
And you can see...

1935
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:50,320
And you can see that our coordinates are staying the same.

1936
02:06:51,100 --> 02:07:02,780
396, the latitude, meaning we're pretty low down in the southern part of the airport by now.

1937
02:07:03,500 --> 02:07:11,680
Now it's our longitude, the west to east coordinate, that is decreasing.

1938
02:07:11,680 --> 02:07:16,000
Since we're going, we were all the way to the east and we're not going west.

1939
02:07:17,120 --> 02:07:26,260
So it's decreasing, we're moving essentially more to the left part, to the left edge of the airport.

1940
02:07:29,720 --> 02:07:34,420
Let me speed up a bit more again, because this is taking forever.

1941
02:07:37,140 --> 02:07:40,080
I hope the passengers are having a good time at least.

1942
02:07:41,680 --> 02:07:58,020
Well, let me do about, because I got pretty relieved by the fact that I was able to land and not crash this time around, which is pretty good.

1943
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:02,940
Let me speed up a bit more.

1944
02:08:02,940 --> 02:08:11,140
55 flaps, 56, 57, 57, 58 flaps, 59, 60 flaps, 60 flaps, 61 flaps, 61 flaps, 62 flaps, 63 flaps extended down.

1945
02:08:11,200 --> 02:08:11,600
300.

1946
02:08:11,680 --> 02:08:14,280
296 Sierra, 1261M.

1947
02:08:16,380 --> 02:08:22,060
Still over 1.2, almost 1.3 kilometers to go on Sierra.

1948
02:08:24,780 --> 02:08:25,620
Excuse me.

1949
02:08:26,360 --> 02:08:27,120
1037M.

1950
02:08:28,760 --> 02:08:36,120
Then we'll be coming to Delta, and we're about to get to Mike and to Zulu and to the stands.

1951
02:08:37,160 --> 02:08:39,520
We're supposed to go to stand 1, right?

1952
02:08:39,780 --> 02:08:41,560
SK624, taxi to stand 1.

1953
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:42,300
Yes.

1954
02:08:42,300 --> 02:08:44,240
763M, gear 0.

1955
02:08:44,240 --> 02:08:45,640
That's right.

1956
02:08:45,640 --> 02:08:49,160
Slow down to 20 again.

1957
02:08:49,160 --> 02:08:52,860
54 flaps extended downwards to 6.

1958
02:08:52,860 --> 02:08:54,300
49 flaps extended downward.

1959
02:08:54,300 --> 02:08:55,160
584M.

1960
02:08:55,160 --> 02:09:00,880
42 flaps extended downwards to 6.

1961
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:04,840
Because we don't want to pass the junction.

1962
02:09:04,840 --> 02:09:06,280
36 flaps extended downwards to 6.

1963
02:09:06,280 --> 02:09:10,380
Because you can't turn 180 degrees with such a large plane.

1964
02:09:10,380 --> 02:09:10,760
The.

1965
02:09:10,760 --> 02:09:15,120
The taxiways and runways are too narrow for that.

1966
02:09:15,120 --> 02:09:23,380
Even on high speeds, you would leave the runway anyway.

1967
02:09:23,380 --> 02:09:30,140
The tower will tell you that it is the case, and it would tell you to get back to your

1968
02:09:30,140 --> 02:09:36,460
path and you would get a penalty point.

1969
02:09:36,460 --> 02:09:39,840
One penalty point per one runway departure.

1970
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:50,560
Like if you're moving outside of the designated runway or taxiway numbers, names, in a basically

1971
02:09:50,560 --> 02:09:57,280
undefined area of the airport, like in the grass, beyond the runways, that's a penalty

1972
02:09:57,280 --> 02:09:58,680
point.

1973
02:09:58,680 --> 02:10:00,320
That's not supposed to be happening.

1974
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:01,320
152M.

1975
02:10:01,320 --> 02:10:02,320
West.

1976
02:10:02,320 --> 02:10:05,640
Going to West on Sierra.

1977
02:10:05,640 --> 02:10:07,920
There's the turning to Delta.

1978
02:10:07,920 --> 02:10:09,200
And we'll be turning left.

1979
02:10:09,200 --> 02:10:10,200
West.

1980
02:10:10,200 --> 02:10:12,660
When we get to Delta, we need to reach it first.

1981
02:10:12,660 --> 02:10:16,860
We need the name to be announced, like the zone that we are currently in.

1982
02:10:16,860 --> 02:10:25,200
And once it is, we can't be doing due west anymore, because Delta is a south-north taxiway.

1983
02:10:25,200 --> 02:10:26,200
Turning left.

1984
02:10:26,200 --> 02:10:27,200
258.

1985
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:29,080
To go due south again.

1986
02:10:29,080 --> 02:10:30,080
258.

1987
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:31,080
258.

1988
02:10:31,080 --> 02:10:32,080
258.

1989
02:10:32,080 --> 02:10:33,080
258.

1990
02:10:33,080 --> 02:10:34,080
258.

1991
02:10:34,080 --> 02:10:35,080
258.

1992
02:10:35,080 --> 02:10:36,080
258.

1993
02:10:36,080 --> 02:10:37,080
258.

1994
02:10:37,080 --> 02:10:38,080
258.

1995
02:10:38,080 --> 02:10:39,080
258.

1996
02:10:39,200 --> 02:10:40,200
258.

1997
02:10:40,200 --> 02:10:41,200
It's zero.

1998
02:10:41,200 --> 02:10:42,200
Dis ofere mak strain 0.

1999
02:10:42,200 --> 02:10:43,200
60.

2000
02:10:43,200 --> 02:10:44,200
0.

2001
02:10:44,200 --> 02:10:45,200
0.

2002
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:46,200
16.

2003
02:10:46,200 --> 02:10:47,200
0.

2004
02:10:47,200 --> 02:10:48,200
179.

2005
02:10:48,200 --> 02:10:49,200
101.

2006
02:10:49,200 --> 02:10:50,200
One hunt.

2007
02:10:50,200 --> 02:10:51,200
South.

2008
02:10:51,200 --> 02:10:52,200
Zero.

2009
02:10:52,200 --> 02:10:53,200
South.

2010
02:10:53,200 --> 02:10:54,200
116M.

2011
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:55,200
That was...

2012
02:10:55,200 --> 02:10:56,200
103M.

2013
02:10:56,200 --> 02:10:57,200
Pure work.

2014
02:10:58,200 --> 02:10:59,200
There's Alpha.

2015
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:00,160
We need to be going east along Alpha, because we don't want to be going West.

2016
02:11:00,160 --> 02:11:01,880
So, we'll turn left.

2017
02:11:01,880 --> 02:11:03,560
90 left.

2018
02:11:03,560 --> 02:11:08,200
Once again, as soon as we're on Alpha, now.

2019
02:11:09,200 --> 02:11:11,080
And that'll lead us to Mike.

2020
02:11:28,420 --> 02:11:30,880
Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, we want to go...

2021
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:38,880
We need to go south again.

2022
02:11:39,200 --> 02:11:39,700
Mike.

2023
02:11:40,620 --> 02:11:41,400
162.

2024
02:11:41,880 --> 02:11:42,180
Mike.

2025
02:11:42,180 --> 02:11:42,680
Mike.

2026
02:11:44,300 --> 02:11:45,060
181.

2027
02:11:45,460 --> 02:11:45,760
South.

2028
02:11:46,260 --> 02:11:46,760
South.

2029
02:11:46,760 --> 02:11:47,860
624m.

2030
02:11:49,040 --> 02:11:50,680
And this is going to take us to Zulu.

2031
02:11:51,380 --> 02:11:58,080
If we passed the Zulu junction, we would be going to the hangars, which we can't.

2032
02:11:58,100 --> 02:12:04,100
We can't park the plane in the hangar yet because we need to onboard the passengers first.

2033
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:07,640
There's the Zulu junction to our left, due east.

2034
02:12:09,200 --> 02:12:11,240
20 flaps extended downwards to 6.

2035
02:12:12,520 --> 02:12:13,200
Zulu.

2036
02:12:14,700 --> 02:12:15,140
Zulu.

2037
02:12:16,140 --> 02:12:16,700
98.

2038
02:12:17,960 --> 02:12:18,440
90.

2039
02:12:18,920 --> 02:12:19,780
Due east.

2040
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:20,440
No.

2041
02:12:22,380 --> 02:12:23,520
Now it's due east.

2042
02:12:23,880 --> 02:12:24,680
660m.

2043
02:12:24,920 --> 02:12:25,280
Gear 0.

2044
02:12:26,460 --> 02:12:26,860
And...

2045
02:12:26,860 --> 02:12:27,880
18 flaps extended downwards to 6.

2046
02:12:27,880 --> 02:12:29,420
Is it going to be stand 5 first?

2047
02:12:29,440 --> 02:12:31,120
Or stand 1 first?

2048
02:12:31,140 --> 02:12:32,200
On this airport.

2049
02:12:32,480 --> 02:12:33,040
I don't remember.

2050
02:12:33,140 --> 02:12:33,880
15 flaps extended.

2051
02:12:34,040 --> 02:12:35,080
14 flaps extended downwards.

2052
02:12:35,220 --> 02:12:35,780
13 flaps extended.

2053
02:12:35,780 --> 02:12:36,700
So let me slow down.

2054
02:12:36,700 --> 02:12:37,080
13 flaps.

2055
02:12:37,160 --> 02:12:37,580
12 flaps.

2056
02:12:37,680 --> 02:12:38,040
12 flaps.

2057
02:12:38,080 --> 02:12:38,520
12 flaps.

2058
02:12:38,620 --> 02:12:38,860
11 flaps.

2059
02:12:38,860 --> 02:12:39,040
11 flaps.

2060
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:39,060
12 flaps.

2061
02:12:39,060 --> 02:12:39,080
12 flaps.

2062
02:12:39,080 --> 02:12:39,100
12 flaps.

2063
02:12:39,200 --> 02:12:42,880
So that I don't overrun it.

2064
02:12:43,600 --> 02:12:44,400
Which one is it?

2065
02:12:44,760 --> 02:12:45,080
Come on.

2066
02:12:45,180 --> 02:12:45,400
Come on.

2067
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:45,660
Come on.

2068
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:47,640
Stand 1.

2069
02:12:47,720 --> 02:12:47,960
1.

2070
02:12:48,320 --> 02:12:48,980
Oh, okay.

2071
02:12:50,820 --> 02:12:51,680
Stand 1.

2072
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:52,340
Better.

2073
02:12:53,800 --> 02:12:55,720
It's a good thing that I slowed down.

2074
02:12:58,800 --> 02:12:59,680
Stand 1.

2075
02:13:02,800 --> 02:13:03,680
Stand 1.

2076
02:13:05,100 --> 02:13:05,540
39.

2077
02:13:05,780 --> 02:13:07,260
I need to turn due north.

2078
02:13:07,260 --> 02:13:09,080
I won't probably be able to make it.

2079
02:13:09,080 --> 02:13:10,080
But I can stop anywhere in the stand.

2080
02:13:10,080 --> 02:13:11,140
That's the benefit.

2081
02:13:11,140 --> 02:13:12,140
Stand 1.

2082
02:13:12,140 --> 02:13:13,140
I will be able to make it.

2083
02:13:13,140 --> 02:13:14,140
Okay.

2084
02:13:14,140 --> 02:13:15,140
Stand 1.

2085
02:13:15,140 --> 02:13:16,140
300.

2086
02:13:16,140 --> 02:13:17,140
300.

2087
02:13:17,140 --> 02:13:18,140
300.

2088
02:13:18,140 --> 02:13:19,140
300.

2089
02:13:19,140 --> 02:13:20,140
North.

2090
02:13:20,140 --> 02:13:21,140
0.

2091
02:13:21,140 --> 02:13:22,140
0.

2092
02:13:22,140 --> 02:13:23,140
North.

2093
02:13:23,140 --> 02:13:24,140
Drake.

2094
02:13:24,140 --> 02:13:25,140
Full stop.

2095
02:13:25,140 --> 02:13:26,140
16.

2096
02:13:26,140 --> 02:13:27,140
Stand 1.

2097
02:13:27,140 --> 02:13:28,140
447.

2098
02:13:28,140 --> 02:13:29,140
Stand 1.

2099
02:13:29,140 --> 02:13:30,140
Wonderful.

2100
02:13:30,140 --> 02:13:33,140
I can turn off the sensor because it's annoying.

2101
02:13:33,140 --> 02:13:34,140
Sensor off.

2102
02:13:34,140 --> 02:13:36,080
I won't be moving anywhere anyway.

2103
02:13:36,080 --> 02:13:37,080
Anymore.

2104
02:13:37,080 --> 02:13:38,080
North.

2105
02:13:38,080 --> 02:13:41,080
I know that I'm...

2106
02:13:41,080 --> 02:13:46,460
So I actually probably turned a bit too early and I'm close to the right side, right edge

2107
02:13:46,460 --> 02:13:47,460
of the stand.

2108
02:13:47,460 --> 02:13:52,340
But since the stands are essentially free to drive through, nothing would happen.

2109
02:13:52,340 --> 02:13:54,340
I would just leave the stand.

2110
02:13:54,340 --> 02:14:02,180
But if this happened in a gate, if I was in a gate and I kept going right or turning right,

2111
02:14:02,180 --> 02:14:06,140
as I was saying at the very beginning, I would just crash into the gate and get wrecked.

2112
02:14:06,140 --> 02:14:07,140
So.

2113
02:14:07,140 --> 02:14:08,140
Let me park.

2114
02:14:08,140 --> 02:14:09,140
Parking brake on.

2115
02:14:09,140 --> 02:14:10,140
Engage the parking brake.

2116
02:14:10,140 --> 02:14:11,140
Let me open the cockpit door so that we can hear everything better.

2117
02:14:11,140 --> 02:14:12,140
Our happy passengers, who seem to be okay.

2118
02:14:12,140 --> 02:14:13,140
Let me ask the tower to onboard them.

2119
02:14:13,140 --> 02:14:14,140
And let me...

2120
02:14:14,140 --> 02:14:15,140
Hey.

2121
02:14:15,140 --> 02:14:16,140
Hey.

2122

stand uh let's not 44 stand 3 let's not tempt it any further 629 stand 3 so let's try this again

2180
02:16:12,680 --> 02:16:17,620
engage the parking brakes parking brakes on open the cockpit doors

2181
02:16:18,220 --> 02:16:24,700

unboarding thank you open the doors the captain doors for them so that they can get the hell

2183
02:16:29,420 --> 02:16:36,560
out opened and you know what i believe we can turn off the engines stopping stopping and the

2184
02:16:36,560 --> 02:16:43,020
ventilation off cabin pressurization off temperature control off tcas off stall indication off

2185
02:16:43,020 --> 02:16:47,680
and the battery radio off transponder off taxi lights off done

2186
02:16:47,880 --> 02:16:51,320
Cabin lights off, strobe lights off, storm radar off,

2187
02:16:51,320 --> 02:16:55,040
computer off, communicator off, atlas off.

2188
02:16:55,040 --> 02:16:58,220
And unfasten our seatbelt.

2189
02:16:58,220 --> 02:17:00,680
Seatbelt unfastened.

2190
02:17:00,680 --> 02:17:02,940
Because we don't need to do anything anymore.

2191
02:17:02,940 --> 02:17:04,920
We don't even need the radio for anything,

2192
02:17:04,920 --> 02:17:08,260
because as soon as they get out, the flight will be over,

2193
02:17:08,260 --> 02:17:10,120
we'll be ranked and evaluated.

2194
02:17:10,120 --> 02:17:15,160
We did not do as good as I hoped to, but never mind,

2195
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:18,540
because it could have turned out worse, too.

2196
02:17:18,540 --> 02:17:22,200
I could have spent more attempts than just two

2197
02:17:22,200 --> 02:17:23,640
on recording this, you know.

2198
02:17:24,620 --> 02:17:28,500
I'm basically just glad it turned out the way it did,

2199
02:17:28,500 --> 02:17:30,340
even though I crashed the first time.

2200
02:17:32,680 --> 02:17:36,140
Now, we have finally safely arrived in our destination,

2201
02:17:36,140 --> 02:17:38,780
and that's the only thing that counts in the end.

2202
02:17:38,780 --> 02:17:40,240
The only thing that matters in history

2203
02:17:40,240 --> 02:17:42,780
is never gonna ask about the first attempt.

2204
02:17:42,780 --> 02:17:44,540
We'll pretend it did not happen,

2205
02:17:44,540 --> 02:17:45,140
and let's just pretend that it didn't happen.

2206
02:17:45,140 --> 02:17:47,180
And let's just pretend it never did.

2207
02:17:50,180 --> 02:17:52,560
Oh, let's just forget it ever did.

2208
02:17:52,560 --> 02:17:53,680
Flight completed.

2209
02:17:53,680 --> 02:17:54,700
You have leveled up.

2210
02:17:54,700 --> 02:17:55,900
I've closed the doors.

2211
02:17:55,900 --> 02:17:56,920
I have leveled up.

2212
02:17:56,920 --> 02:17:58,220
I've completed the flight.

2213
02:18:01,060 --> 02:18:04,560
The passengers are safe in their final destination,

2214
02:18:04,560 --> 02:18:06,740
and I can have a day off as a pilot.

2215
02:18:06,740 --> 02:18:09,360
I can go get a beer or something.

2216
02:18:09,360 --> 02:18:11,380
But before I do that, let's take a look

2217
02:18:11,380 --> 02:18:12,920
at the flight evaluation together.

2218
02:18:12,920 --> 02:18:13,920
Flight evaluation.

2219
02:18:13,920 --> 02:18:14,960
Successful flight.

2220
02:18:15,140 --> 02:18:16,640
Successful flight.

2221
02:18:16,640 --> 02:18:18,440
Like I said, that's what counts.

2222
02:18:18,440 --> 02:18:21,060
That's what matters, not the crash before.

2223
02:18:21,060 --> 02:18:22,260
Shush, what are you talking about?

2224
02:18:22,260 --> 02:18:23,100
What crash?

2225
02:18:23,100 --> 02:18:24,180
There was no crash, ever.

2226
02:18:24,180 --> 02:18:25,180
Successful flight.

2227
02:18:25,180 --> 02:18:27,500
Flight length, 295 kilometers.

2228
02:18:27,500 --> 02:18:29,540
Flight duration, 48 minutes.

2229
02:18:29,540 --> 02:18:30,500
Points, one.

2230
02:18:30,500 --> 02:18:31,100
Let me see.

2231
02:18:31,100 --> 02:18:32,220
I even gained a point.

2232
02:18:32,220 --> 02:18:33,020
Gained a point, OK?

2233
02:18:33,020 --> 02:18:33,980
Earnings, one.

2234
02:18:33,980 --> 02:18:34,980
And I earned one euro.

2235
02:18:34,980 --> 02:18:36,200
Minor crashes, zero.

2236
02:18:36,200 --> 02:18:37,040
Minor crashes, zero.

2237
02:18:37,040 --> 02:18:38,180
Penalty points, zero.

2238
02:18:38,180 --> 02:18:39,500
Penalty points, zero.

2239
02:18:39,500 --> 02:18:41,360
So I, yeah.

2240
02:18:41,360 --> 02:18:43,100
Because, yeah, but of course, because I did not, ever, ever,

2241
02:18:43,100 --> 02:18:48,560
because I did not, ever, like, depart the runway

2242
02:18:48,560 --> 02:18:52,340
without permission, or enter the runway without permission,

2243
02:18:52,340 --> 02:18:54,400
or start the engines without permission.

2244
02:18:54,400 --> 02:18:55,500
Blink, blink.

2245
02:18:55,500 --> 02:18:56,480
I did not do anything.

2246
02:18:56,480 --> 02:18:59,000
So you know what?

2247
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,160
I know you keep repeating the word crash,

2248
02:19:01,160 --> 02:19:02,540
but what are you talking about?

2249
02:19:02,540 --> 02:19:05,180
The flight was a complete success.

2250
02:19:05,180 --> 02:19:08,720
And there was no mistakes or errors, ever.

2251
02:19:08,720 --> 02:19:13,060
It was the golden standard of how

2252
02:19:13,100 --> 02:19:15,340
flights in Eurofly 3 should be done.

2253
02:19:15,340 --> 02:19:19,560
Even with category 3 airplanes, which I don't even own anymore,

2254
02:19:19,560 --> 02:19:21,620
which I don't even own yet.

2255
02:19:21,620 --> 02:19:23,400
But who cares about that, you know?

2256
02:19:23,400 --> 02:19:30,260
It's like, what matters is that you saw, no, no, no.

2257
02:19:30,260 --> 02:19:31,200
All joking aside.

2258
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:32,240
Press Enter to quit.

2259
02:19:32,240 --> 02:19:33,320
Free flights.

2260
02:19:33,320 --> 02:19:35,540
Let's get back to the main menu.

2261
02:19:35,540 --> 02:19:38,500
All jokes aside, I hope, I really sincerely

2262
02:19:38,500 --> 02:19:42,640
hope you've enjoyed this, because it was, after all,

2263
02:19:42,640 --> 02:19:49,360
a complete flight from start to finish, as it should be,

2264
02:19:49,360 --> 02:19:51,680
everything included, all the steps in the checklist

2265
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:53,120
that you need to do in order for

2266
02:19:53,120 --> 02:19:55,220
your flight to be successful in the end.

2267
02:19:55,220 --> 02:19:59,520
Well, besides my asking for the landing clearance,

2268
02:19:59,520 --> 02:20:02,840
and besides the taxi lights and landing lights.

2269
02:20:02,840 --> 02:20:06,840
But these are actually quite minor infractions

2270
02:20:06,840 --> 02:20:09,960
that, as you can see, I was not even penalized for.

2271
02:20:09,960 --> 02:20:12,420
I should actually be penalized for landing

2272
02:20:12,420 --> 02:20:19,740
without clearance I'm probably going to report that one as a bug but other than that I think

2273
02:20:19,740 --> 02:20:25,540
it turned out pretty okay considering all I had to do and all I had to explain in the meantime

2274
02:20:25,540 --> 02:20:33,140
with literally almost no waiting for me to finish my explanations so that was it that was your the

2275
02:20:33,140 --> 02:20:40,200
first official English demonstration of Eurofly 3 for you almost half a year well not almost

2276
02:20:40,200 --> 02:20:46,480
exactly half a year after the Slovak one we were actually genuinely believing by the time the

2277
02:20:46,480 --> 02:20:51,480
Slovak one which which is still available on this YouTube channel was published we did actually

2278
02:20:51,480 --> 02:20:57,560
believe it's like a matter of a couple days or a couple weeks at the very most for the game to

2279
02:20:57,560 --> 02:21:03,640
come out and to get released but as I was saying before real life schedules were getting in the way

2280
02:21:03,640 --> 02:21:09,320
as well as more bugs to fix more bugs that were being discovered

2281
02:21:09,320 --> 02:21:10,180
more new

2282
02:21:10,180 --> 02:21:18,500
features or changes really important and necessary ones that were being asked for for example the the

2283
02:21:18,500 --> 02:21:23,980
landing process the way you land as I was just demonstrating a while ago the way it's currently

2284
02:21:23,980 --> 02:21:30,620
done in a version 3 was still different and it was it was still the old one from version 2 by

2285
02:21:30,620 --> 02:21:35,560
the time the Slovak presentation was being recorded so that's that's it for you that's

2286
02:21:35,560 --> 02:21:39,300
the English demo for you hope you liked it you found it entertaining by the way and I hope you

2287
02:21:39,300 --> 02:21:40,160
enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next one bye bye

2288
02:21:40,180 --> 02:21:46,020
not only that but I also hope that it actually taught you or showed you the very basic principles

2289
02:21:46,020 --> 02:21:55,740
of how to start doing things so that you have at least a rough idea of how things done how things

2290
02:21:55,740 --> 02:22:02,700
are done and what is what once you start playing the game for yourself in a couple days or maybe

2291
02:22:02,700 --> 02:22:09,480
even now if you've discovered this recording a bit later on because on the day of its publishing

2292
02:22:10,180 --> 02:22:20,260
that's when the series of audio recordings is starting to be published one recording per day

2293
02:22:20,260 --> 02:22:27,640
the whole audio tutorial series all the 15 basic recordings in the basic series as I was saying at

2294
02:22:27,640 --> 02:22:37,820
the beginning and once those are out and released it's time for the closed private beta so things

2295
02:22:37,820 --> 02:22:39,020
are definitely moving on

2296
02:22:40,180 --> 02:23:04,180
I know some of you who were familiar with Eurofly before and may have been waiting for version 3 may have had your doubts or may have lost faith in the development team and may have started thinking that no version 3 is ever going to to come out at all ever and that it's all just empty promises so I hope this recording helps you helps at least partially to

2297
02:23:04,180 --> 02:23:06,180
to

2298
02:23:06,180 --> 02:23:08,180
to

2299
02:23:08,180 --> 02:23:10,180
eliminate

2300
02:23:10,180 --> 02:23:36,180
that doubt and for those of you who have never even played Eurofly before at all who have discovered the game for the first time via this recording but got interested and excited about the game and can't wait to try it hands-on for yourself I wish you the best of success the best of luck as few crashes and stalls as possible I hope I wish you to become a good pilot soon and perhaps better than I am soon

2301
02:23:36,180 --> 02:23:38,180
to become a good pilot soon and perhaps better than I am soon

2302
02:23:38,180 --> 02:23:40,180
to become a good pilot soon and perhaps better than I am soon

2303
02:23:40,180 --> 02:23:42,180
than I am soon

2304
02:23:42,180 --> 02:23:44,180
and I can't wait to meet you in the air at work each of us flying

2305
